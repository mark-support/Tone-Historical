      <p>
	Madison producer and singer Ethan Jackson has been teasing his vision of bizarro yet genuine and disarming R&amp;B for a few years now under the name&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mr-Jackson/451212931626571" target="_blank">Mr. Jackson</a>, releasing a few tracks here and there and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsEtz0Luae4" target="_blank">hypnotic, honey-drenched video</a> for his song "The Golden Treatment." Last week, the Madison artist finally gave us something more cohesive in the album&nbsp;<a href="http://misterjackson.bandcamp.com/album/the-golden-hour-groove-session" target="_blank"><em>The Golden Hour Groove Session</em></a>. The album explores a variety of takes on synth-driven funk, from the staccato stomp of "Now Who Be" to the jump-cut sampling of "Brazilian Wives" to&nbsp;the pillowy chords of "I Vibe With Gold." Jackson presides over it with vocals that jump between a falsetto croon and a commanding baritone, and the effect is at once catchy, playful, and a bit disorienting.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the music is all Jackson, he still thinks of Mr. Jackson as a collaborative project.&nbsp;He worked&nbsp;closely with Madison filmmaker Michael Doyle Olson on the "Golden Treatment" video and a new double-feature video for "Ms. L" (probably the best track on the album, with Jackson's vocal hooks and propulsive hi-hats combining in a chill yet dynamic groove) and "Synth Bride." Jackson&nbsp;also thinks of audio engineer Quentin Henning, who mixed the album,&nbsp;and artist Terrence Adeyanju, who created the <em>Golden Hour </em>album&nbsp;art, as pretty essential to the project. Jackson also has gradually been working on How It's Done, a series of shows that aim to mix up local artists from different genres. Ahead of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1509162342667740/" target="_blank">December 2 show at The Frequency</a>, Jackson talked with us about trying to create a positive vibe on the album and why he stays open to collaboration.</p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4215982647/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3416794874/transparent=true/" seamless="">
&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href="http://misterjackson.bandcamp.com/album/the-golden-hour-groove-session"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;The Golden Hour Groove Session by MR. JACKSON&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
</iframe><p>
	<br>
	<strong>Tone Madison: You've billed the album as being intended to "help listeners capture their own golden hour." What made you want to center a whole album around a particular mood or emotional moment?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>
	Ethan Jackson:</strong> I felt like all people could find a familiarity with wanting to have a golden hour or a golden year or something that was special, or a golden birthday. Essentially you could take a rock and paint it gold and then give it to somebody and be like, "Oh, that's golden now." You can do that with just a thought about how your life is. I feel like everybody has something like that.</p><p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: So it sounds like that could be something from "I just had a really big event in my life" to just "I'm having a really nice day."</strong></p><p>
	<strong>
	Ethan Jackson:</strong> Yeah, taking appreciation to not finding yourself battling, giving yourself a part on the back for just small things, because I feel like there's a lot of negativity that we can build through in our own minds that will keep us from doing a lot of good things in our lives. So if we give ourselves time to look back and congratulate ourselves for getting through things and other people that have helped you do those things too, it's good to have that.</p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4215982647/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2074296587/transparent=true/" seamless="">

</iframe><p>
	<br>
	<strong>Tone Madison: How did the Mr. Jackson project come about?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>
	Ethan Jackson:</strong> I started doing it when I was 20 years old. I really was more into hip-hop, and I still am. I love beatmakers like 9th Wonder and Pete Rock and classic guys, Dilla. But I love other types of music. I had a friend named David Weber, he goes by the name of Jerry Gari and he was doing his music in Madison around the time that I wanted to start doing music. I used to go to his house all the time and make music, and we used to have shows together. He kind of got me into doing what I wanted to do in music, instead of what was just accepted, and to present it well enough where it could be interpreted well. Ever since then I've been trying to really present projects well and not rush myself on anything. I feel like there's so much out there that's telling you to do so many things at the same time, and sometimes you forget to build a foundation. At the end of the day, after a certain point, if you're a musician, you owe yourself and the people around you a responsibility to keep creating and to make it organic to yourself.</p><p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: What did you start doing first, production or vocals?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>
	Ethan Jackson:</strong> I think it all kind of came out at once, because I realized that I couldn't do one without trying to do the other. At first I thought I couldn't sing well, and then I loved it so much that I didn't care how I came off singing—I was just gonna sing and present it anyway. Call it ego or whatever you want, I just didn't care. But when it came down to the actual music side, I did have to learn from a lot of different friends and a lot of people who to present music well. I didn't train in music professionally, I would be the closest to what you would call an instrumental producer without the equipment to make it, I guess, but it's one of those things where I think that's where I can be honest about—I love the fact that I had to take different things, when it comes down to how I present my style of music, from other people and artists. They taught me, even when it comes down to singing on a track, from the way I sing and what I'm trying to provoke. When I started trying to make a song that somebody would like, I'd have to get the beat to be somewhat provoking first, and I feel like life kind of does the rest when it comes down to writing the song.</p><p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: The Mr. Jackson project kind of seem to have a persona or character to it. Is that intentional or is that just kind of how it comes out?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>
	Ethan Jackson:</strong> I feel like that comes from the expressions of the people that have worked on the album. it's not just my expression, it's also the artist's expression, Terrence Adeyanju, who's a good artist in town. The guy who mixed the album, Quentin Henning, Terrence's brother, and the video director, Michael Doyle Olson, who's helped me when it comes to pushing out the project. Their expressions are involved too, to the point where if there's a persona, then I want there to be a different persona for everybody who listens to the album or agrees with it. If I were to say it was something, it would kind of take away what somebody else would want it to be. I just released it. I don't know what it is to people yet, but I know what it is to me, and it's just a positive expression of what I feel about parts of my life and some of the goofiness, and it's just a little piece of my character that now can be given away and shared. I want it to ignite expressions on other people that don't only involve music, but also art, poetry, and all those types of things, because I really do think that when people express more, then that's when change happens. When people say, "You've got to give back to your community," if my expressions don't create the mindset for change in the community, then I'm not doing anything. That's why I don't try to promote profanity in my music, I don't try to promote a lot of different things that people maybe shy away from?</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JpB6viB9YB0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe><p>
	<br>
	<strong>Tone Madison: So do you approach music with something of a value system?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>
	Ethan Jackson: </strong>I wouldn't say that, because I feel like it's a slippery slope to say that you have a value system for your music. Music can't have a cap. I can't tell you what I'm going to make five years from now or how provocative or whatever that might be, but I can say that when it comes down to the place that I'm trying to present at this point in my life, that's exactly what people are going to get. Sometimes the music doesn't always come from positivity. Sometimes it's pain. Sometimes people say the best music comes out of pain. It goes back to the interpreter. That song, that album, could be a lot of shades of my life, could be a lot of shades of somebody else's experiences, or it could just be something for the interpreter to try to figure out.</p><p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: How did you arrive at the vocal style for Mr. Jackson, where you have a lot of high falsetto stuff and a lot of baritone and not a lot of in between?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>
	Ethan Jackson:</strong> If I was naive I'd say it's my own. I'd say, "Oh yeah, that's just how I thing." But I feel like it comes from the different styles of music I listened to when I was younger. I listened to Funkadelic and a lot of Rick James and a lot of Michael Jackson. To emulate is one thing, but to try and emulate and make your own is another thing, and I'm not naive enough to say that that's just me, but I thing I take from the music I listened to as a child and what I like to hear. When I first started making music, it was the music that I wanted to listen to. Not to say that I listen to my own music all day. I'm a dusties head, I like old-school jazz, but when it comes down to the vocal style, I guess, a lot of funk artists and a lot of '80s artists. I like to think that because I have such a low voice, I have to embody the thought of those old singers, like Teddy Pendergrass. If I can't sing like Whitney Houston, bless her soul, I still will try to get my emotion across with my voice. I don't know if I'm ever gonna sing in an opera, but I think I'm making it work.</p><p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: What were the songs on the album that you found most interesting or challenging to make?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>
	Ethan Jackson:</strong> None of them were challenging to put together. I think I took long enough—I took 10 months making it, so none of them were that challenging to make. The most challenging part of making the album was breaking every sound down by itself and picking where the songs should go in order. Me and the guy who mixed the music with me, Quentin Henning, we were very deliberate about what we thought the vibe should be, and based on the track list, I think we felt we did a good job, but every song is just an expression of my life or somebody else's, or totally make up. That's the reason why I like making music, because I can decide whatever it is at any time.</p><p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: So you're playing and singing everything, but you still think of it as a very collaborative project, where the album art and the videos are all really integral.</strong></p><p>
	<strong>
	Ethan Jackson: </strong>Oh, totally. I think expressions become even better when you just give them up and you can trust somebody else with it. Nobody has built a castle on their own. Not that's not what I'm trying to do, but nobody has tried to build anything beautiful on their own, or something that could be measured by something great. I like letting people know where different expressions come from. If I didn't have an amazing artist, <em>The Golden Hour Groove Session</em> would've come with a picture of me, or something that wouldn't be gripping. You can't do a lot on your own when you're trying to be a one-man artist, and I realized that really quick. I wouldn't even call them a team—I couldn't do anything without those three dudes. It's hard sometimes to let go of your expression because you never know what somebody's going to do with it, but if you just sit back it usually makes your job way easier.</p><p>
	<br>
	<strong>Tone Madison: It seems like a lot of people first come to your music through the videos.</strong></p><p>
	<strong>
	Ethan Jackson: </strong>I can give Michael an idea of what I'm trying to provoke. I might have a really extravagant, crazy idea. Making videos has become probably the most fun part of the entire project. If I could make videos for songs that weren't even mine, I would do it, because it's fun to do. There's just something about trying to be new but not trying to overshadow what you're trying to provoke, because sometimes things can be way too crazy.

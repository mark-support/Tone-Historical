	One of Wisconsin's most significant, and least intentional, contributions to American music and culture will get a heady dissection this Thursday through Saturday, when the UW-Madison Center for the Humanities hosts a 
	<a href="http://humanities.wisc.edu/events/special-events/calendar#the-rise-and-fall-and-rise-of-paramount-records" target="_blank">series of panels and an interactive art event</a> focused on Grafton, Wisconsin's long-gone Paramount Records. The label, a subsidiary of the Port Washington-based Wisconsin Chair Company was founded to help sell phonograph cabinets, its cheaply recorded and pressed 78s intended as little more than a promotional gimmick for furniture. But between the 1910s and its eventual demise amid the Great Depression, Paramount put out a damn-near definitive cross-section of blues, jazz, gospel, and old-time music, among other sounds. Caring little about the music itself, the company managed to amass a discography that included Son House, Skip James, Charley Patton, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Fats Waller, King Oliver, and many of their more obscure but no less fascinating contemporaries.
</p>
<p>
	This week's event comes on the heels of an elaborate two-volume box set, 
	<em>The Rise And Fall Of Paramount Records 1917-1932</em>. <a href="http://revenantrecords.com/musics/releases/" target="_blank">Revenant Records</a>, a label founded by the late John Fahey and his friend Dean Blackwood, produced the box set in partnership with Jack White's Third Man Records. Together, the two labels are well-equipped to finally treat this music with some care: While Revenant's output has spanned from Americana anthologies to more recent creations from sonic searchers including Sir Richard Bishop and No-Neck Blues Band, Third Man has become the <a href="http://thirdmanrecords.com/more/novelties/record-booth/" target="_blank">mad-scientist one-upper of the vinyl revival</a>. (The volumes retail at $400 each, but I'm told you can check them out at UW-Madison's Mills Music Library.) This week's panels will feature two important out-of-town guests: Blackwood, who served as executive producer on the box set, and music journalist Amanda Petrusich, who has also explored the esoteric history of American music in her books <em>It Still Moves</em> and <em>Do Not Sell At Any Price</em>. Madisonians taking part will include UW-Madison art historian Ann Smart Martin, UW-Madison music librarian Tom Caw, and musician Simon Balto. Blackwood talked with me yesterday as he began his drive up from Austin, and we discussed the history of Paramount, why he defends making two expensive box sets, and his experiences sharing Paramount recordings with audiences around the country.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: Now that you've got some hindsight on the Paramount Records project, what's been the most interesting part of it for you?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Dean Blackwood: </strong>Well, it was a pretty sprawling affair, both in its scope and in just the time horizon for it. I probably started it close to four years ago. I've done long-form projects—that's kind of been our bread and butter—but this was the one with the longest runway and involved the most moving parts and contributors. It was great and totally beyond expectations, in terms of working with the folks at Third Man and Jack, and so many people were really intimately involved with key components of the set in a way that I hadn't really experienced before. There's always a team involved—I'm not much of an expert on anything, or particularly good at any one thing, so I like to surround myself with people that are experts on a particular thing or have a particular skill they can devote to the task. It was the most satisfying creative collaboration I've ever been a part of.
</p>
<p>
	As far as the subject itself, I mean, it just kept revealing itself in layers. We did this big box set on Charley Patton, who's one of the key figures in the Paramount story, and we've done other collections and anthologies that included artists who'd recorded for Paramount. We did a collection of this guy Dock Boggs, who's a white Appalachian banjo player and singer, and he even had a connection to Paramount. We were always sort of bumping up against it, and so the story had this sort of teasing quality to it—“Oh, I should really find out more about how that came to be." It took on this curious-tale quality to it, because in the end, this ended up being the single greatest repository of American vernacular music that was made during the 1920s and early '30s, and yet it was produced by a commercial concern that had really no interest in being any kind of purveyor of culture, or even any understanding of the cultural aspects of this, unlike the Library of Congress, who didn't begin their field-recording operations until the '30s.

<p>
	<br>
	Ironically, it was precisely because [Paramount] didn't care, and didn't see this as any kind of cultural mission, and were just trying to move anything that would sell, and because they didn't really understand their audiences, particularly black audiences. The primary motivations were cheapness and expediency all filtered through only the dimmest understanding of their audience ironically leads to them recording all this fantastic stuff and being the only ones doing it, probably because they didn't filter it. They didn't know how to filter it. They couldn't apply qualitative judgment, which ends up working to our benefit. We hear a lot of stuff that other people wouldn't have recorded, because they would have seen it as too primitive or not fitting something else they understood or already had a hit making formula. Paramount didn't even have enough of a feel for it to do that. Now, it's not all bumbling happenstance and pure luck and chance. They hired this guy <a href="http://ivy50.com/blackHistory/story.aspx?sid=12/26/2006" target="_blank">J. Mayo Williams</a>, and he ended up being their entree into black nightlife in Chicago in the '20s, which was pretty much their key to everything, at least during that period. Later, they had links to Mississippi, being really the first label to feature Mississippi delta blues recordings. That was through other regional scouts they had. But the first piece of incredible good fortune was having J. Mayo Williams in their camp. It's like all along the way, kind of in spite of themselves, they became this juggernaut. The layers of that story, as they revealed themselves, was really the most fascinating thing. I knew of artists but I didn't really know the narrative of the label itself, so having an opportunity to learn about it and figure out the best way to tell it was the most fascinating part and the key mission that we were all engaged with in producing the set.

<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: One of the panels you're doing this week is all about commodification and turning music into a commercial object. How did your thinking about that evolve as you went about making the box sets? Especially as you're making this really elaborate product to commemorate this company that created a legacy that it never intended to have?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Dean Blackwood: </strong>The way we looked at it was, as we were putting this together, “What would Paramount have done if they gave a shit, which they didn't, and if they had any money, which they also didn't?" They were notorious for having the worst-sounding records, even though they had the best artists. They didn't want to pay for any of the work that would have been involved in good-sounding records. Even by the standards of the day, they were really bad, and they age much more poorly because they were made of inferior materials. The cheapest possible shellac formula was used, with lots of filler, and stuff that made it vulnerable to wear. They never had a state-of-the-art, even for the time, recording facilities. And they weren't pressed with the best equipment. So you end up with these things that sound very tinny and sort of distant, like they were recorded down a hall behind a closed door, and there's an amazing amount of surface noise. Even if you can find an unplayed copy, it's still really bad.
</p>
<p>
	So, in all this, we were thinking, “Well, how can we sort of subvert that and do something in a physical form that's more of a tribute to the greatness of the music than to Paramount's own sense of aesthetics or quality?" We felt like it should be enshrined somewhere, and it's really not. There's not a museum you could go to where you can hear this stuff, and because of Paramount's unique position in really being the seat of recording a lot of sounds that are lost to time. Because some of the timing of the stuff they were recording at that time, even as poorly as they were recording it, they were really the only ones who were doing so. A lot of sounds that didn't survive the '20s just simply went unrecorded. You could have whole traditions that would be lost to time but for Paramount having caught them.

<p>
	<strong>
	<br>
	Tone Madison: And it's especially ironic that it's come full-circle with Third Man, which is really into elaborate vinyl products even when it's not making a big box set.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Dean Blackwood:</strong> Some people have taken issue with the fact that this is a nice product and therefore it's not cheap. I mean, we tried to really focus on the value of it. Over the course of these two sets, 1,600 tracks, 12 heavy-laid vinyl LPs, four huge books, and these sculpted cases that are all handmade. Any way you look at it, it's a great value. Does that mean it's prohibitively expensive for some folks? No doubt about it. But that would act as a disincentive to make anything that truly can be said to enshrine this permanently in a high-quality way. To do less than that, we would've had to cut some corners. If all you want are digital tracks, you can find most of the stuff. In fact, most of it was probably available on BitTorrent or Pirate Bay basically upon release. There's no need to complain about us requiring you to get this stuff. We were trying to tell the story in a different way that engages people in a kind of multi-sensory experience, much like being at a museum, because this stuff really isn't enshrined anywhere.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: Another panel you're doing is about all the non-blues music Paramount put out, and that's probably what people are least familiar with. What are some of your favorite outliers?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Dean Blackwood:</strong> Some of the stuff in the process of putting this together was for me a revelatory thing as well. I wasn't that familiar with the stuff that falls outside of the so-called race records series. There was some stuff here and there that wasn't actually black performers that they included in the race records series—it's possible they didn't know the nature of the performer, but it's probably more likely, again, them not knowing what made something a hit or interesting to black audiences. So there are some records in this series that are not blues, jazz, or gospel performances. They usually fall into this kind of, I don't know, songster realm. A lot of the people that came out of vaudeville performance styles, there really was a lot of merger between black and white styles. But they also had a series beginning in 1927 of hillbilly—they would call it “old-time," that was kind of their name for hillbilly or country music before it was called that. They'd also call it “Southern tunes," you'd see that sometimes in their catalogs. There's a lot of pretty great stuff within the kind of non-race records. Wilmer Watts was really a big discovery for me. He does a version of the Casey Jones theme that's on one of the LPs.

	<br>
	<strong>Tone Madison: You've done a lot of events and talks around the box sets already. What has that experience been like?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Dean Blackwood: </strong>We've done a bunch of these things. I was pleasantly surprised at the interest in doing these sorts of programs and having the opportunity to tell these stories. For volume one, we did a big event at the New York Public Library, the downtown branch, which is a beautiful place. It helps if you have Jack White sitting on your panel with you as far as attendance goes, but we must have had 600-plus people there. Really these are just opportunities, if I had anything to say about it, to play the music. If there's a benefit to be had in going to any of these educational programs about a particular musical topic, most of the benefit can be derived from hearing the music rather than hearing somebody talk about it. We've tried to make that a key part of the programming at each of the vents we've done. We use it as an opportunity to play whole songs, not just excerpts, because there's so much that happens across the course of these two-and-a-half- to three-minute nuggets, so that's been really gratifying, just having the opportunity to play whole songs for people in a room where we can then contextualize it, but what's better than really hearing the stuff? We did one at Yale recently for volume two and had a great turnout.
</p>
<p>
	Just seeing people respond to it, we wanted to connect it to the modern ear in a way, but then again it's not like we pulled out all the stops and did a Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame tour to link up Blind Lemon Jefferson to Hendrix—you can go that route, and I wondered, if we didn't go that route, would we find people being responsive to the sounds? There's just so much stuff besides all the intervening history of rock music, and there's just so much content out there and so many ways to consume it. That was one of the core questions at the heart of this: Can people work up an interest in this, and it's a pretty immersive thing, a saturating kind of experience to engage with this material in this sort of way. It's not like we're somehow trending towards greater attention spans. We're increasingly fragmented in the way we approach things, and the way we consume content is ever more diffuse, so that was one of the questions. Even though this is, we think, the very bedrock of not just American vernacular music but of American culture, can you get people to be engaged in it without sort of trotting out, getting Jack to perform at all these things and make it relevant for people and pull out his Son House cover. It was refreshing that we haven't had to do that. We weren't gonna do that anyway, but the idea that people could still be turned on by it was great.

    <article>
      <p>
	We almost never do concert reviews here on <em>Tone Madison</em>. They’re frankly just a pain in the ass, and when we’re out at shows, we like to enjoy the music and talk to people about what’s going on in the music community, which is hard to do when scratching out notes and trying to remember song titles. That said, we have enjoyed a great year of live music here in Madison. In all honesty we probably missed as many great things as we saw, but here are some highlights from among the diverse touring acts who hit Madison this year.</p><p>
	<strong>Superchunk, January 19 at High Noon Saloon</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>
	About this time last year I ran a piece&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tonemadison.com/articles/what-makes-a-fest-a-fest/" target="_blank">grousing</a> about how January has become a sort of silly “festival” season in Madison, with promoters and venues essentially dousing a few club shows in extra branding juice in an understandable efforts to liven up Madison’s live-music lineup in the dead of winter. That said, I was no less excited for the mighty Superchunk to close out 2014’s FRZN Fest, and indeed they left me in a slap-happy daze. A leaping Mac McCaughan led the band through an impassioned set that spanned from ye olde classics like “Skip Steps 1 &amp; 3” to highlights from the excellent new albums <em>Majesty Shredding</em> and <em>I Hate Music</em>. There’s just something beautiful and generous about a band that’s been together that long putting so much into a performance, and continuing to write great songs. McCaughan gets extra points for telling the crowd that the band would have liked to honor Wisconsin with a Die Kreuzen cover.<strong> —Scott</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Califone and William Tyler, January 23 at High Noon Saloon</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>
	Califone have just been around for such a long time that it’s easy to take them for granted, and sometimes their live shows can get a bit dragged-out and aimless. But here, a playful Tim Rutili and company just managed to get me excited again—something about Rutili’s vulnerable, unvarnished vocals and the band’s murky swirl of acoustic and electronic elements gelled in a way that inspired me to start listening to their albums a lot more often, especially 2006’s Roots &amp; Crowns and 2013’s Stitches. And either way, the show would’ve been a treat for Tennessee guitarist William Tyler’s masterful, audacious opening set. <strong>—Scott</strong></p><figure data-type="quote"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-version="4" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);">

	<strong>Sklar Brothers, February 22 at Majestic&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	Over the past six or seven years, Madison really has become a better town for comedy fans. In 2014, Madison continued its steady increase in exciting touring comedy shows, and arguably the most exciting was Randy and Jason Sklar’s decision to tape two shows at the Majestic for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tonemadison.com/articles/madison-makes-the-cut-in-sklar-brothers-new-special/" target="_blank">their special <em>What Are We Talkin’ About?</em></a> The dynamically twinned duo performed a lot of bits from previously released albums, but that’s still some of my favorite recent stand-up material anyway, and the shows certainly made for a solid introduction for anyone new to the Sklars. <strong>—Scott</strong></p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/109293752" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe><p>
	<strong>Low, March 24 at Majestic and May 7 at Shitty Barn&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	Low played two double-set, no-opener shows in the area within weeks of each other. I don’t need to say much else—I feel I can always count on Alan Sparhawk, Mimi Parker, and Steve Garrington to come off as the nicest, humblest band to ever hit the stage, but create powerful, deeply finessed music. In March at the Majestic, the band closed out the show with “The Last Snowstorm Of The Year,” and then sent the unwitting audience walking out into yet another snowfall; other highlights included an extended version of “Do You Know How To Waltz?” Both shows featured covers of both Rihanna’s “Stay” and Bruce Springsteen’s “I’m On Fire.” <strong>—Scott</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Angel Olsen and Sky Ferreira, May 3 at Revelry&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	The second-annual Revelry festival on the UW-Madison campus was pretty well put together, all in all. There’s the matter of Waka Flocka Flame goofing off and doing very little rapping during his headlining set (also G Eazy is gross), but the day was more than worth it for the earlier back-to-back sets from Angel Olsen and Sky Ferreira. Olsen’s patient, brooding folk-rock doesn’t have much in common with Ferreira’s gloriously snarling pop, but both turned in excellent vocal performances and sent me back to their records with fresh ears. <strong>—Scott</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Strollin’ Schenk’s Corners, May 23 on the near east side&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	The Greater Madison Jazz Consortium’s series of three Strollin’ events this year brought diverse lineups of Wisconsin jazz artists to venues and other businesses in different Madison neighborhoods. The first one, centered around the busy intersection of Winnebago Street and Atwood Avenue, was exciting on several levels. First, Strollin’ coordinators Nick Moran and Rob Lundberg really tried to get all across the spectrum of jazz, from vocalists like Michelle Duvall to free-jazz explorers like Brennan Connors And Stray Passage. (I’m not sure why there was a guy in a lawn chair reading The Financial Times during the latter’s set at Thorps hair salon, but life must have its mysteries.) It also played off the feel of the neighborhood in a way a street festival wouldn’t. Just as importantly, the organizers worked with non-profits and local businesses to work out an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tonemadison.com/articles/the-strollin-jazz-series-promising-model/" target="_blank">interesting model for paying the bands</a>. <strong>—Scott</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Panther, May 29 at Inferno&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	It was good to see Madison thrash-monsters Panther one last time before vocalist Marit Saint moved out of Madison. At this show, opening for punk legends D.R.I., Panther gave as merciless a farewell performance as I could have asked for, complete with flying-V guitar solos, guttural black-metal-ish vocals, and a chugging fury that lay somewhere between Iron Maiden and Exodus. <strong>—Scott</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Charanjit Singh, July 12 at La Fete De Marquette&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	The summer neighborhood festivals on the east side have been&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tonemadison.com/articles/why-la-fete-de-marquettes-electronic-music-stage-matters/" target="_blank">getting more ambitious</a> with mixing electronic music into their established mix of world, folk, and Cajun sounds. This year, the most exciting act in the electronic tent was a modest-looking 72-year-old picking out unhurried, bright melodies on a Roland synthesizer. This was Bollywood composer-turned-electronic-pioneer Charanjit Singh, kicking off his first-ever run of performances in the United States. With Dutch DJ and engineer Johan Westerman by his side handling a drum machine and some samples, Singh kept the performance simple and euphoric. It began pouring rain during the set, and it was more than worth crowding into the tent, or just getting drenched. <strong>—Scott</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Ka, July 18 at the Terrace&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	In what he said was his first-ever performance outside of New York City, Brooklyn rapper Ka came off every bit as understated and methodical as he does on his two albums, 2012’s <em>Grief Pedigree</em> and 2013’s <em>The Night’s Gambit</em>. Not many people actually showed up to see him—it was a busy night in town, with Tune-Yards, Dosh, and Speedy Ortiz playing the Live On King Street series, and the show wasn’t promoted very well. For the few of us standing up at the stage, Ka’s set proved intimate and self-effacing in a way that live hip-hop rarely does. Ka spent part of the set sitting on a chair, the rest pacing around as he carefully worked through his songs—but this suited the material perfectly. <strong>—Scott</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Chris Forsyth &amp; Solar Motel Band, July 13 at The Frequency&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	One of my favorite records this year was Philadelphia guitarist Chris Forsyth’s <em>Intensity Ghost</em>, recorded with his recently formed Solar Motel Band. Before I even heard that album, I got to see just what a powerful outfit Forsyth has pulled together, in a set of expansive, twang-tinged instrumentals. Forsyth’s guitar playing—stepping away from his more avant-garde work in favor of melodic clarity—was the main attraction, but the whole band, especially drummer Steven Urgo, brought the tunes to vivid life. <strong>—Scott</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Samarah, March 19 at High Noon Saloon&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	My list of favorite shows this year may seem a bit too top-heavy with electronic artists, but that's because it is. This was an excellent year in Madison for deep-listening laptop-fuckery, synth goons, and damaged dance music. Fond Du Lac's Samarah, whom I feel is one of Wisconsin's most innovative and underrated electronic weirdos, made an overdue return to Madison in March for a head-engulfing, bass-heavy set at High Noon Saloon. Employing a laptop, synthesizer, and MIDI controller, her set featured tunes that pivoted between floating ambient textures, off-kilter grooves, and shards of finely sliced samples that built upon her work from almost a decade ago, when she was a bit more active and co-operating Belladonna Records. <strong>—Joel</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Rene Hell, February 1 at Good Style Shop&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	If my list also seems a bit heavy on shows I helped set up this year, because all the shows I set up these days are from artists whose work I'm personally stoked on, and just want to share it with the community, even if it means reaching into my own pocket and taking a loss. The truth is that Madison doesn't have a huge "scene" for weird music, there's no built-in audience, and if one of these freaks is touring through my region and I want to see them play, I often have to pony up a guarantee by myself and take the hit if nobody else wants to show up for it. I've resigned myself to this role and, as a result, many of my favorite shows of the year were those that I set up myself. One interesting thing about Madison is that, despite the absence of a proper scene for any singular style of fucked music, there are a bunch of interesting artists doing their own things, playing specific roles, and setting up certain sorts of shows in the community. My role this year has been putting on shows that feature deep-listening laptop-fuckery, damaged dance music, and mind-bending synth workouts.  While Rene Hell's (aka Jeff Witscher's) performance at Good Style Shop on February 1 was remarkably stoic and still from a physical standpoint (via his tight, unflinching focus on his laptop screen), the sonic dynamism of his set, as ripped his way through a series of brain-prodding frequencies and mangled found-sound that he manipulated in real-time, was a constantly shifting and evolving mindfuck in the best way. —Joel</p><p>
	<strong>John Wiese, May 5 at the Dragonfly&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
This show, from another one of my favorite sonic manglers, was surprisingly an even broader sonic voyage, casting aside some of the harsher aspects of Wiese's earlier work in favor of something a bit closer to the well-sculpted sonic palette of the 
	<em>Seven Of Wands</em> LP that Wiese released with PAN back in 2011. With just a strange, custom switch-box, a laptop, and several cables dangling out of his laptop interface and plugged into his mixer, Wiese pulled the the audience from deep oceanic drones into airy space crawling with warped, slithering high frequencies, and then occasionally pulled them back down into a clattering, head-spinning hell full of what sounded like wildly panning found sound and field recordings being chopped and processed in real time. <strong>—Joel</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Patricia, July 24 at the Dragonfly&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	While Brooklyn techno soldier Max Ravitz, aka Patricia, shares some of Wiese and Rene Hell’s insane grasp on sound design and synthesis, his focus is less on putting you in a certain headspace and more about making you move. Lording over his gear with a contemplative smirk, Patricia employed a big rack of modular synths, a couple samplers, the legendary TB-303 acid-house synth, and some other assorted gadgetry, and handily stirred Dragonfly Lounge's dance-floor into soup on July 24th. A few other stray favorites that come to mind would be an incredibly dynamic farewell set from Burial Hex (featuring Samantha Glass' Beau Devereaux backing him up on synths, a drum machine, and other assorted gadgetry) at The Cult House on February 7, a blistering set from Lima, Ohio’s filth-kings of power violence Pizza HiFive at The Wisco on February 27, and an incredible vocal and drum performance from the inimitable Jon Mueller at Dragonfly Lounge on October 7. <strong>—Joel</strong></p>

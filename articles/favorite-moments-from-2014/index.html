      <p>
	We asked a bunch of the people who keep Madison interesting to share their favorite music and arts moments from 2014. And you know what? Some of them got back to us. Here’s what they had to say.</p><p>
	<strong>Bradley Thomas, aka&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://dlonline.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">DLO</a><strong>, rapper and producer&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	It was great to see two new hip hop bands emerge:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/314814858728843/" target="_blank">Dogs of War</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/FringeCharacter" target="_blank">Fringe Character</a>. I got to meet DMC and rock with the kids of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/blackstardrumlinemadison" target="_blank">Black Star Drum&nbsp;Line</a> in front of B.O.B. 2014 was the start of many great things to come for Madison hip hop.</p><p>
	<strong>Emily Mills,&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://ourlivesmadison.com/" target="_blank"><em>Our Lives</em></a><strong>&nbsp;editor and <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em> contributor&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	The first Queer Pressure dance party on the train car. I am SO HAPPY that there is, once again, a dedicated dance party for the LGBTQ community, one that has done an excellent job of being both super fun and inclusive, and super self-policing against bullshit/douchebaggery. And I love that they've found some interesting new places to hold these parties—frequently the Dragonfly, but then showing up to this rad party on a train car that went until like 3 in the morning? So good.</p><p>
	Grrrls Kick Ass Fest 2 at the Frequency: My band, Damsel Trash, got to take part in this along with Venus In Furs, Skizzwhores, When Flying Feels Like Falling, and Bumsey and the Moochers. It was insanely awesome to be part of such a rad line-up of lady-fronted/all-lady punk and rock acts. The place was PACKED. People actually danced and thrashed. And when Cynthia from ViF realized it was all dudes up by the stage at one point, having her get to yell "GIRLS TO THE FRONT!" and then come out into the audience to chastise this one guy who was out of control and being a total asshole—while still playing her guitar—was kind of the best. After that a bunch of women in the crowd just surrounded the dude and basically kicked him to the back of the room, and then took over the space by the stage. That's punk rock right there.</p><p>
	<strong>Kelly Hiser, co-founder of MUSICcat and Yahara Music Library&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	A joint concert by&nbsp;<a href="http://clocksinmotionpercussion.com/" target="_blank">Clocks In Motion</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blackmarigold.com/" target="_blank">Black Marigold</a> at Luther Memorial Church on April 12. The concert was part of a music grad student conference, and featured the work of student composers, several of whom were there. Both ensembles sounded fantastic in the space, but what really struck me was the conversation the two groups had afterwards with the audience. This built-in Q&amp;A session became a long rumination on being a working musician in a city like Madison, and although it was really obvious that doing that work was all kinds of difficult, it was also clear that the folks in both ensembles had really thoughtful justifications for doing what they do and were incredibly gracious about their work. It was just this lovely, warm moment, plus a bunch of musicologists and theorists in the room.</p><p>
	Also, I have to say that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tonemadison.com/articles/johannes-wallmann-readies-his-sweet-minute-big-band/" target="_blank">Johannes Wallmann</a>'s&nbsp;presence on campus is something I really felt and was thankful for. I loved being able to walk into the Rathskeller on most given Fridays and hear some combination of him and/or his students. Jazz and beer at 5 on Fridays can really help keep one sane.</p><p>
	<strong>Ben Taylor, comedian, Atlas Improv Company member&nbsp;and Nerd Nite Madison organizer&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	It was at Mickey's back in August. Free show. Disembodied Monks and Obnox opened, totally fine-tuned, raucous and rattling. Then The Hussy, where Bobby and Heather just murder it, and at the end of the set, Bobby hops on the bar, shreds, kicks a cup full of beer flying against the rear wall, hits the floor, and lights his goddamn guitar on fire. Just drops the thing right in the middle of the room, drops fluid on it, and ignites. I had never seen anyone light a guitar on fire before. It was like being in a riot. The energy in the room warped into this beautiful confusion, and I felt truly terrified and spellbound. It was the best performance I saw all year.</p><p>
	<strong>Pacal Bayley, aka DJ Pain 1&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	My favorite local music moment was more of a series of moments. I was recruited to judge The Overture Center for the Arts’ first local talent competition [http://www.overturecenter.org/programs/rising-stars]. I was able to see a cross-section of so much talent, from songwriter&nbsp;<a href="http://gabeburdulis.com/" target="_blank">Gabe Burdulis</a> to&nbsp;<a href="http://kalaanjali.com/" target="_blank">Kalaanjali Dance Company</a>—the variety was amazing. I saw a few favorites including Black Star Drum Line and Perry Williams, but had I not been a part of the event, I wouldn't have worked on the band&nbsp;<a href="http://www.isawthecreature.com/music" target="_blank">I Saw The Creature's album</a>.</p><p>
	<strong>Brian Steele, musician and High Noon Saloon staffer&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	First things I can think of performance wise would be&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hairyspiderlegs.com/web/artists/tar-pet/" target="_blank">Tar Pet</a>'s first solo show, my first time seeing Myrmidons at the Frequency, Kinit Her's performance of “<a href="http://kinither.bandcamp.com/track/hyperion" target="_blank">Hyperion</a>” at the Yardfest experimental music festival outside Madison. Yardfest in general was magical, as was Spires That In The Sunset Rise’s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tonemadison.com/articles/exit-interview-kathleen-baird/" target="_blank">last performance at Shockrasonica</a> with Jon Mueller and Andy Fitzpatrick.&nbsp;</p><p>Metalesque (Panther, The Garza, Moon Curse, Burlesque (!) and Brian Maiden) was a perfectly run show from beginning to end, even when I lost my voice, the appearance of Stoneking in the front row kept the perfection coasting.  Does Jex Thoth count?  The Days of the Doomed show in Milwaukee with Jex opening for Trouble, with Troy Peterson doing the psychedelic screen in the backround was one of the best things ever.  The birth of Grotto, amazing multiple shows by newcomers Bereft, Mr.&nbsp;Jackson, Coordinated Suicides, Sardonyx, Red Museum, The Tea Heads. Mr Jackson and Myrmidons at the Wisco - a wonderfuly surreal night of prog/r&amp;b/dancing at a historic biker bar. favorite Samantha Glass show was gracing a blown PA at the Phoenix co-op. I had countless horrible days that somehow ended right with good vibes and great people at Shockrasonica.  Every show at the Cult House.  I don't remember going to a lot of Good Style shows, but the show that ONO played really stood out as one of my favorite nights.  Burial Hex's <em>The Heirophant</em> getting released to 5 star rave reviews by the some of the coolest publications in the world.  But if you only had to put one thing in there, it would be Yardfest (Julian Lynch, Kinit Her, Spires, Black Light, Samabtha Glass, Country Shadows and touring acts Itasca and Skygreen Leopards), it was a night of good vibes and perfect weather out in the country, tasty food made by the owner and people actually brought their tents and slept over as planned.  I hope this message wasn't too annoying to read.  There is a&nbsp;lot more, I know it, but this is what I came up with at the top of my head.</p><p><strong>Jane Burns, journalist, Wisconsin State Journal</strong></p><p>The summer festivals, particularly in the small towns of Dane County, are the places where cover bands such as Super Tuesday and Madison County tend to headline for a beer-soaked summer crowd. So imagine my surprise to think of one of the more sublime musical moments came in a tent adjoining the beer tent at a small-town festival.</p><p>The Union Suits, an Americana/outlaw country band, are based in Minneapolis but some of the guys in the band are from Mount Horeb. So the Union Suits tend to book a few Mount Horeb gigs from time to time. Lucky Mount Horeb.</p><p>At the Mount Horeb Summer Frolic, the Union Suits had an early evening gig before the main act came on. It’s a quiet time at the festival, when the hum of the rides and the calls from the bingo tent can carry into the music tent. On this Saturday evening, it was even quieter – a power outage had all but shut the festival down. The Union Suits were supposed to hit the stage, but couldn’t.</p><p>So a few loyal sorts who knew of the Union Suits or went to high school with them or were their parents hung out, drank their beer and waited for the music to begin. Then, without power, music began.</p><p>On a picnic table away from the stage, the band’s lead singer, Max Markin and the band’s sometime fiddler,  Mike “Razz” Russell, sat on a picnic table and performed an impromptu version of “Sunday Morning Coming Down.” It’s one of my favorite songs anyway, and with Russell’s melancholy fiddle, it was even more heart-breaking than it usually is.</p><p>The mini-performance was a microcosm of what the band is – young guys full of gumption with the well-traveled Russell lending a hand. Russell is a white-haired fiddler probably twice the age of the rest of the guys in the band. He has played with the Jayhawks is currently in a band called the Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers and has a well-worn look that seems a perfect fit for an actual union suit.</p><p>The music was spontaneous and perfect, but what it did even better was show the beauty of live music at any sort of venue. You never know what’s going to happen and you never know what you’re going to hear. That’s a beautiful thing, and it doesn’t matter if it’s in the finest concert hall in the world or in a beer tent at a small-town festival.</p><p>
	<strong>Nick Moran, jazz musician and event organizer&nbsp;</strong></p><p>
	<em>As a performer:</em> It was a Sunday in September and I had three gigs back to back. I played an informal brunch style wedding reception with my wife, Megan Moran and Dave Stoler at Tenney Park. The father of the bride hired me for this after seeing me perform at the Ben Sidran Salon at The Cardinal. He was super kind and treated us great. The newlyweds were amazing people and looked super happy. After that gig, I sped to the Willy Street Fair to perform with Golpe Tierra. We are newer band so it was great to be asked to perform. We brought the Afro Peruvian fire to the east side and they were digging us. Tony Barba joined us on bass clarinet on a few tunes which was a first for us. Tony and his bass clarinet sounded great and the sound was really unique. After that set, I had an hour to enjoy the Willy Street Fair with my mom and my aunt Betsy. We ate so much yummy fest food. My last gig was on the same stage I had already played at but this time the group was Madisalsa. That band is a salsa powerhouse and Madison institution. We closed the Fest and had everyone dancing. I remember thinking that I was a lucky motherfucker and I love my job.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBH8Rwg8cY4" target="_blank">I didn't have to use my AK</a>.</p><p>
	<em>As a spectator:</em>&nbsp;<a href="http://sacerdote.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Sacerdote</a>’s EP release on September 6 at Bright Red Studios. I knew each member of this group individually as talented UW music school students but had never heard the band. It was Sacerdote's last show as the members had just graduated and some were about to move away. Apparently, they had been getting together for the last few years at the drummers parents’ house to craft and record really cool songs. Their music was super complex and beautiful. They all sang, which was surprising to me, and the vocals blended really well. Although it rocked hard, Bright Red Studios has great acoustics and absorbed the extra volume. BRS is an art gallery with an awesome BYOB policy that allowed my wife and I to bring in a sixer of tasty beer. I liked the venue so much that I encouraged my own band, Sinister Resonance, to book a show there. Sacerdote's show reminded me that I need to go out and hear more bands that I don't know in spaces I'm unfamiliar with, or I might miss something special, unique, and inspiring.</p><p>
	<em>Also:</em> Ásgeir on October 11 at The Play Circle (not a local band but...) My wife and I weren't gigging on this particular Saturday. We almost fell victim to laziness and stayed home. Instead we decided to go out for live music and pried ourselves off the couch. After catching the end of an amazing brass concert at Mills Hall (UW), I knew some bands were playing at the Fredric March Play Circle, but I hadn't heard of either group. I wanted to investigate the space after playing there myself at the Isthmus Jazz Fest and really digged the sound and layout in the newly renovated room. We missed the opener but Ásgeir was incredible, especially when he played some songs in his native Icelandic. The tunes were odd meter with both electronic and sensitive acoustic vocals and harmonies. He also did an amazing cover of Nirvana's “Heart Shaped Box.” The Play Circle was jam packed with sweaty college and high school kids. It was a loud show but the Play Circle sounded as warm and balanced as when I played there with Dave Stoler's Trio or The New Breed. We need more of these types of rooms in Madison.</p>

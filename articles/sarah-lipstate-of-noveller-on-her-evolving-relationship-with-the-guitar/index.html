	Sarah Lipstate's new album as 
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/novellermusic" target="_blank">Noveller</a>, this year's <em><a href="http://www.sarahlipstate.com/#music-section" target="_blank">Fantastic Planet</a></em>, finds the Austin/NYC musician taking a decisive leap beyond the project's beginnings as an experimental-guitar outlet. Since Lipstate started Noveller in 2005, her deliberate melodic sensibilities have gradually come into balance with her deft manipulation of textures, effects, and swelling, physically powerful dynamics. On <em>Fantastic Planet</em>, Lipstate lets the guitar come to the fore as a compositional force, shaping delicate tones but putting concise melodic phrases at the center. From the stately opener “Into The Dunes" to the more playful “Sisters," the entire album comes off as confident, balanced, and accomplished, neither timid nor too awash in experimental noise. Lipstate, who has also collaborated with Parts &amp; Labor and Lee Ranaldo, and joined musician-comedian Reggie Watts on a 2013 live tour with the <em>Radiolab</em> show, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/595509107250871/" target="_blank">brings Noveller to The Frequency this Friday</a>, opening for The Soft Moon. Lipstate talked with us about writing the new record and how her relationship with the guitar has changed over the years.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: You've mentioned in other interviews that the song “Pulse Point" was kind of a starting point for writing the album. Were there particular themes or approaches in that song that you wanted to expand on?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Sarah Lipstate:</strong> I think the main reason that it was the starting point was just because I had spent the most time developing that song. I started writing it after I had done a tour with Radiolab, and that was when I actually got the one synth that I used to create the beat for that song. It's one of the first songs of mine to ever actually have a beat. But I'd gotten this OP-1 synth from Reggie Watts, who'd also done the <em>Radiolab</em> tour, and I really wanted to try using it and incorporating it into what I was doing. So because the song was initially so different, with having a beat and starting with a synthesizer, I think I just needed to spend a lot of time figuring it out. A lot of the other pieces on the album started out with a synth. I also had gotten a Microbrute synth, which is an analog synthesizer, and the song “Sisters" started out with a synth part, and the guitar sort of developed around it. I just felt freer to experiment and start at a different origin part than with a guitar melody.

<p>
	<br>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Right, I was going to bring up “Sisters," because it kind of jumped out at me how you used the guitar to create the rhythm in that song.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Sarah Lipstate:</strong> Right. Yeah, the melody in the beginning of the song, I originally came up with that on piano, and I was working on a score for a corporate video I'd been asked to do music for. They ended up killing the score that I'd done, but I felt like some of the music was really interesting, so I decided to take this piano melody and learn how to play it on guitar and it ended up sounding really interesting.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: Do you think writing on other instruments, and then translating those ideas back to guitar, is refreshing, or challenges you to approach the instrument differently?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Sarah Lipstate: </strong>Yeah, it's definitely interesting. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't, but as I find myself working more on other music projects that use piano or synth or strings, then naturally if I come up with something that I think is worth expanding upon, then I'm going to get out my guitar. Noveller is still very much a guitar-centric project. But yeah, I think that is kind of a way to push myself or just have a fresh approach or keep the excitement when I'm writing for Noveller.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: A lot of your peers in this solo-electric-guitar realm like to make the guitar sound not like the guitar—especially someone like, say, Ken Camden—and in Noveller there's some element of that, but mostly you still really emphasize those recognizable sounds and timbers of the electric guitar. What keeps you coming back to those sounds, when obviously you're capable of creating more abstract sounds?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Sarah Lipstate: </strong>When I first started doing this project, I viewed the guitar as just a sound source and rarely played it in any traditional sense. I didn't even use a six-string guitar for a long time—I just had this double-neck Epiphone SG copy, and it was so heavy that I couldn't even wear it like a traditional guitar. I'd just lay it on a keyboard stand and drop chains on it or use a bow with it and run it through the effects pedals. Over the course of time, I wanted more, and from a practical standpoint, it made a lot more sense to travel using a regular six-string guitar than bringing this monstrous double-necked guitar out of the country.
</p>
<p>
	It became more interesting to change my compositional approach, make it less improvisational, less abstract. I think I'm always going to be interested in incorporating guitar sounds that you don't necessarily identify as guitar immediately. I can't really think of anything I've written that's a traditional guitar song, but the project is changing and it can be relatable and feature the guitar as an instrument that people know, but also maybe challenge the sounds that they're accustomed to hearing from it.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: On <em>Fantastic Planet</em>, were you deliberately going for a more melodic and structured approach to the songs?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Sarah Lipstate:</strong> I always get excited when I start writing something that's different from previous stuff that I've written. I remember when I came up with “Rubicon" and initially I was playing around with the layers and an arpeggiated melody, and then these big distorted power chords come in. The first time I played that, I thought it was so funny that I was playing distorted power chords. It was really fun and I'd never done that before in my music, and I couldn't tell if it was going to be something usable for the record or just something that I would record and save on my computer for some future project. As I started working it out and adding different elements to it, it seemed like, “Oh, you know, this is cool and I want this to be a part of my record, and it may kind of stand alone as being the only song that takes a more post-rock approach, but I like it." It wasn't a conscious decision, but when it happened it was exciting.

<p>
	<br>
	<strong>Tone Madison: How has the new material taken shape in a live setting?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Sarah Lipstate: </strong>A lot of the pieces from the new record that I'm playing live, it took a while to figure out how to make that happen and have it sound the way that I wanted it to sound. Especially “Rubicon," which I really like playing live, it's really fun, and different from my other songs, but I had to learn a whole different way of using my looping pedal, because the song is rhythmic and usually the other pieces, they're more ambient and it doesn't matter if the loops all line up. I had to learn to use this more sequenced setting on my looper that locks everything in, so the loops all happen at exactly the same time. I add the power chords in after I've recorded the arpeggiated section and it all syncs up perfectly. It was hard to get that down, but it's also fun. I usually get pretty attached to the live versions, so if I happen to listen again to the album version, it sounds off to me.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: What's next for you?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Sarah Lipstate: </strong>I'm going to be doing three shows in May [<a href="http://www.walkerart.org/calendar/2015/victoire-glasser-noveller" target="_blank">including one at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis</a>], and all three shows are with Glasser and Missy Mazzoli's ensemble, and we're all going to be collaborating on some of our material that we've selected that we want other people to play on. There's a song on <em>Fantastic Planet</em> called “No Unholy Mountain," and I sent the recording to Missy Mazzoli and they have vocalists, a flautist, a cellist, all this diverse instrumentation, and they're going to come up with an arrangement of my song and they're going to play it live with me. Something like that is just a really incredible opportunity.

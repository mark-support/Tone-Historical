	If you're hoping to get a comprehensive picture of this year's 
	<a href="http://www.wifilmfest.org/" target="_blank">Wisconsin Film Festival</a> lineup, don't worry: You won't. This year's festival, running April 9 through 16, has 160 titles (counting all the short films), and, as usual, the variety and ambitious curation isn't easy to wrap one's head around. (And in years of going to WFF we've found they don't book many duds, which in a way just aggravates the glorious option paralysis of it all.) We've had barely a couple of days with the full list of films ahead of the full schedule's release today in <em>The Capital Times</em> and at <a href="http://2015.wifilmfest.org" target="_blank">2015.wifilmfest.org</a>. The general public doesn't have much time to digest the lineup, either, as tickets go on sale this Saturday at noon and things tend to sell out fast. So just embrace it and tunnel your own brave, weird way through. That's what we'll be doing as we preview the festival these next few weeks with our partners at <a href="http://madfilm.org/" target="_blank">Madison Film Forum</a> and <a href="http://lakefrontrow.com/" target="_blank">LakeFrontRow</a>. Also, Chris Lay has put together <a href="http://letterboxd.com/toteschris/list/wi-film-fest-2015/" target="_blank">this handy Letterboxd list of WFF '15 picks</a>. To start off, a look at 12 films that jump out at us at first glance.
</p>
<p>
	<em><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Roar</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
	The poster for 
	<em>Roar</em> reads: “No animals were harmed in the making of this film. 70 cast and crew members were." And that arguably misguided courting of danger is what distinguishes Noel Marshall's 1981 animal thriller. When you watch action movies, the terror in the eyes of the cast is all acting. There are safety nets all around, both literal and metaphorical. Not so with <em>Roar</em>, where every day there was a very real chance for significant injury on set. Most notably, cinematographer Jan de Bont being required 220 stitches after being scalped by a lion, and Marshall was gored so many times that he was eventually hospitalized with gangrene.

	<br>
	<em><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">World Of Tomorrow
	</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
	We're predicting that this is going to be one of the hottest tickets this year, which feels a little unusual for a collection of animated shorts. The whole set of shorts is titularly built around 
	<a href="http://www.bitterfilms.com/" target="_blank">Don Hertzfeldt</a>'s <em>World Of Tomorrow</em>, which won the Short Film Grand Jury Prize at Sundance this year. Hertzfeldt started off with humorous shorts like the infamous <em>Rejected</em> and <em>Billy's Balloon</em>, which were studies in brilliantly twisted absurdity and perfectly edited comic timing. If you missed Hertzfeldt presenting <em>Everything Will Be OK</em>, his profoundly moving unpackaging of mental illness, at the 2012 WFF, you might recognize him as the creator of <a href="http://youtu.be/m78gYyTrG7Y" target="_blank">one of the most insane <em>Simpsons</em> couch gags ever</a>.<br>

</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	<em>A Town Called Panic: The Christmas Log</em> (screening together with <em>World Of Tomorrow</em>)
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Winner of the 2009 Fantastic Fest audience award, the original 
	<em>Town Called Panic</em> tells the insane stop-motion-animated story of Cowboy (a cowboy) and Indian (an indian) wanting to surprise their friend Horse (a horse) with a barbecue on his birthday. All hell breaks loose and over the course of the film's 75-minute run time they end up trekking through a parallel reality at the bottom of the ocean, the molten center of earth, and an icy tundra. We can't wait to see what sort of surreally sweet and yuletide seasonably suitable anarchic travels await our heroes in this follow-up.

	<br>
	<em><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Manglehorn
	</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
	A few years ago David Gordon Green seemed lost in the woods, figuratively, with back-to-back stinkers 
	<em>Your Highness</em> and <em>The Sitter</em>, but thankfully he returned to form with <em>Prince Avalanche</em> and <em>Joe</em>, the latter of which screened at WFF just last year with the director in attendance. Perhaps<em>Manglehorn </em>will continue the streak: The top-billed cast looks pretty sterling, with Al Pacino starring as an ex-con gnawing on regret and lost love, and Holly Hunter as a bank teller whom Pacino seizes on as a potential new romantic interest. Also worth noting is that Harmony Korine makes an appearance in front of the camera, for whatever reason it is that one casts Harmony Korine in small parts in films.

	<br>
	<strong><em data-redactor-tag="em">Polyester</em> in Odorama
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	On the one hand, the fact that you can't smell what's going on in most John Waters movies is probably for the best. That said, for 1981's 
	<em>Polyester</em>, Waters created a scratch-n-sniff card with 10 different smells that viewers were to unleash at designated points during the film. The smells, ranging from the pleasant (roses, pizza) to the gross (farts, old shoes, model-airplane glue), both pay homage to the failed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smell-O-Vision" target="_blank">Smell-O-Vision</a> gimmick of old and accentuate a key plot device. Divine stars as Francine Fishpaw (a quintessentially John Waters character name if there ever was one), a suburban housewife whose family slides into depravity, and much of the story is driven by Francine's keen sense of smell. Lately, enterprising film curators and a <a href="http://www.aromaco.co.uk/odoramaisback" target="_blank">British scent-technology company</a> have brought the cards back for a revival, so even though Polyester was something of a crossover success for Waters, here you can experience it in the wonderfully kitschy and somewhat gross way he intended. Co-star Tab Hunter gets his own spotlight elsewhere at WFF, in the documentary <em>Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making Of A Movie Star</em>, and in the 1958 Western <em>Gunman's Walk</em>.

	<strong><em data-redactor-tag="em">Kurt Cobain: Montage Of Heck</em>
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	We'll be taking a separate look soon at the music-related highlights of this year's WFF, but it's a safe bet that the most anticipated musical moment will be Brett Corben's documentary on Kurt Cobain, long in the works and made with the blessing and help of widow Courtney Love and daughter Frances Bean Cobain (Frances is listed as an executive producer, but Corben has said the family gave him the final cut). Like all rock stars who die young, Cobain is both lionized and garishly pillaged, so it's great to read 
	<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/08/kurt-cobain-nirvana-montage-of-heck-brett-morgen-interview" target="_blank">reports from the film's Sundance premiere</a> in January that suggest Corben has really dug deep into the man and found some balance, making goof use of unprecedented access to archival materials including journals and home recordings. It clocks in at 2 hours and 12 minutes, so there's good reason to hope this will begin to give us the sobering, in-depth, empathetic analysis that Cobain's complex and tragic life deserves. We're getting it here a bit ahead of its HBO premiere in May.

<p>
	<strong><em data-redactor-tag="em">
	The End Of The Tour
	</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Cobain's not the only revered, mercurial, and tragically lost figure surfacing in this year's festival. In The End Of The Tour, director James Ponsoldt (
	<em>Smashed</em>, <em>The Spectacular Now</em>) fictionalizes the time author David Foster Wallace (Jason Segel) and journalist David Lipsky (Jesse Eisenberg) spent together during Wallace's 1996 promotional tour for his novel <em>Infinite Jest</em>. Lipsky later turned their conversations on the trip into the 2010 book <em>Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself</em>. Though early reviews have been promising, Wallace's estate has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-the-david-foster-wallace-estate-comes-out-against-end-of-the-tour-20140421-story.html" target="_blank">in no uncertain terms</a> come out against the film.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><em data-redactor-tag="em">
	The Look Of Silence
	</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
	In 2012's documentary 
	<em>The Act Of Killing</em>, filmmakers Joshua Oppenheimer and Christine Cynn tracked down several men who participated in Indonesia's political slaughter of more than a million dissidents and ethnic Chinese residents following a 1965 military coup. They found their subjects not only living free and unpunished, but also all too willing to talk about the slaughter they helped carry out and stage elaborate, at times surreal, reenactments of their crimes. In the new <em>The Look Of Silence</em>, Oppenheimer takes the story to a more personal level, following an Indonesian family that lost a member to the genocide as they confront the perpetrators. <em>The Act Of Killing</em> was justly praised for its brave exploration of power and impunity, and what we know about The Look Of Silence suggests Oppenheimer and the victim's family took on even greater risks (and delved even more deeply into the unsettling nuances of humanity's darkest side) this time around.

	<br>
	<strong><em data-redactor-tag="em">Western
	</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
	Brothers Bill and Turner Ross make documentaries that find an elusive seam between candid observation and intoxicating wonder—following three kids through a night in New Orleans, their 2012 film 
	<em><a href="http://www.oscilloscope.net/films/film/82/Tchoupitoulas" target="_blank">Tchoupitoulas</a></em> captured the rarified air of that city, and of a child's wonder, but never became too fanciful or romanticized. For the new <em>Western</em>, the Ross Bros. went to the U.S.-Mexico border and delved into the relationship between the adjacent cities of Eagle Pass, Texas and Piedras Negras, Mexico. We know the film takes in both the friendship between the two towns and the tensions that arise over violence and border enforcement; but as inherently political as the border is, the Ross Bros' previous work gives us hope that <em>Western</em> will delve into the lives of these neighbor cities on another level entirely.
</p>
<p>
	<strong><em data-redactor-tag="em">Uncle John</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
	One consistent but also consistently underappreciated strength of WFF is thrillers, and not necessarily ones that fit into neat genre tropes (though said tropes get plenty of fun play as well). Every year there's at least a strong handful of films that take a subdued, moody approach to suspense and mystery. First-time director Steven Piet's 
	<em>Uncle John</em>, shot in Illinois and Wisconsin, stars longtime character actor John Ashton as a man wrapped up in the disappearance of one of his neighbors in a rural community. Piet and co-writer Erik Crary (a Lodi native and UW-Madison alum) have let out very little about the plot—<a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/watch-sxsw-trailer-for-uncle-john-ratchets-up-small-town-tensions-exclusive-20150227" target="_blank">this Indiewire post</a> seems to be the most detailed thing they've released, and even that's not much. The trailer's rumbling, scratchy music and laconic, tense shots intercut with violence give <em>Uncle John</em> some pretty big expectations to live up to. This will definitely be on the list when we start pelting the long-suffering WFF staff with screener requests. (Goofy/charming side note: See <a href="http://www.johnashton.com/newsandevents.html" target="_blank">Ashton's blog</a> for his excitement at getting good feedback on Uncle John from David Lynch, followed by Lots of buzz on the <em>Beverly Hills Cop IV</em> front, but still nothing definite yet," followed by updates on his golf game.)

	</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
	In a first glance at the WFF schedule it's tempting to get to get a little top-heavy with documentaries—it's easier to latch onto the subject matter and process of a doc than to grasp the substance of a narrative film—but forgive us this last one for now. For 
	<em>The Iron Ministry</em>, J.P. Sniadecki spent three years traveling China's railway system, using the trains to explore both the country's geography and its evolving social, political, economic and ethnic structures. From clips and reviews, it's clear that what Sniadecki tells us about China here isn't didactic or overt, but rather a product of getting immersed in the life of trains and their passengers, leveling a patient gaze that converts cramped compartments into paradoxically vast worlds. Sniadecki is a member of Harvard's Sensory Ethnography Lab, and his SEL colleagues Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Véréna Paravel made the vertigo-inducing, immersive commercial-fishing documentary <em>Leviathan</em>, which screened at WFF 2013.

</p>
<p>
	Swedish director Roy Andersson has a reputation for blending absurdist humor with a relentless, bleak take on the human condition—"he makes movies that assemble loosely connected, blackly comic sketches, usually shot in one take and often with elaborate staging," Noel Murray 
	<a href="https://thedissolve.com/features/postcards-from-tiff/740-day-2-95-the-tale-of-two-festivals/" target="_blank">wrote recently for The Dissolve</a>. His latest, <em>A Pigeon Sat On A Branch Reflecting On Existence</em>, easily offers the most bewildering and intriguing plot line we've found in scouring the festival's listings: Here, said storylines include a pair of traveling novelty-item salesmen and an 18th-century Swedish king, among more overtly brutal/darkly comic plot points. Pigeon forms what Andersson has called his “trilogy about being a human being" with 2000's <em>Songs From The Second Floor</em> and 2007's <em>You The Living</em>.

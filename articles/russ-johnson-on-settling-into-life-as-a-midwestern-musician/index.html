	Trumpeter Russ Johnson's 2014 album 
	<em><a href="https://timdaisyrelayrecords.bandcamp.com/album/meeting-point-relay-008" target="_blank">Meeting Point</a></em> showcases a set of patient, richly melodic compositions sharpened with just a bit of abrasive experimentation. It's also an indication that the Racine native is thriving creatively now that he's back in the Midwest. He moved to Milwaukee about four years ago for a job teaching music at UW-Parkside in Kenosha. Before that, he lived and played in New York City for 23 years, but instead of letting academia put a damper on his performance career, Johnson has also spent a ton of time traveling down to Chicago and building up new collaborations. He recorded <em>Meeting Point</em> with three Chicago musicians—drummer Tim Daisy, bass clarinet player Jason Stein, and bassist Anton Hatwich—who will join him for a <a href="http://madisonmusiccollective.org/Events/RussJohnson.shtml" target="_blank">February 8 afternoon show at the Brink Lounge</a>. The show will feature much of the <em>Meeting Point</em> material and some new compositions.

	<br>
	Outside of teaching and his Chicago-centered collaborations, Johnson also occasionally makes it to Madison to play with pianist and UW-Madison jazz professor Johannes Wallmann. He's started a few new collaborations in Milwaukee, including with guitarist 
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/kennyreichertjazz" target="_blank">Kenny Reichert</a>, with whom he's playing <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/render?eid=a2lqbTBncDVqaTRtODNmbTJyMzRzdWExMzQgb2hiYWEyY3Q4bmZpNHI2aTJwdTNvaXBvbGtAZw&amp;ctz=America/Chicago&amp;sf=true&amp;output=xml#f" target="_blank">at the Memorial Union on February 13</a>. Ahead of his two upcoming shows in Madison, Johnson met up with me to discuss <em>Meeting Point</em> and the other album he released in 2014, the Eric Dolphy tribute 
	<em><a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/russ-johnsons-still-out-to-lunch/Event?oid=15250453" target="_blank">Still Out To Lunch</a></em>.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: Last year in addition to <em>Meeting Point</em>, you did <em>Still Out To Lunch</em>, a tribute to Eric Dolphy's <em>Out To Lunch</em>. The series of “conversations" tracks on <em>Meeting Point</em>, where you do a one-on-one improvisation with each of the different band members, made me think of Dolphy too, because he has that album <em>Conversations</em> where he does these great piece that's just him and Richard Davis, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF3Ppbq7Bzs" target="_blank">Alone Together</a>."</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Russ Johnson:</strong>  I didn't even think about the Dolphy record at the time, but it does kind of tie in. The rest of the record is my compositions, but I did three relatively short improvisations, each with a different one of the band members. I planned those to be, for lack of a better phrase, a palate cleanser, between some of the music, because some of the music I write can be pretty dense and thick and some of it's actually what I think is quite beautiful. Most of my compositions tend to run fairly lengthy. “Confluence" I had to divide into three parts because it's a 15-minute ballad, basically. It was performed as one piece and it's really one piece, but I knew if there was gonna be any radio play, nobody was gonna play a tune that's a 15-minute ballad.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: With titles like <em>Meeting Point</em> and “Confluence" and “Conversation," is there a theme at work of things converging?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Russ Johnson:</strong> Most of the song titles come after the fact. But for me, leaving New York was a huge step, and the Chicago community, once I moved here—it took me about nine months—but that community, with that tune, I wanted to feature everybody with a spot that I thought would feature what they do as a strength. So I composed that tune with that in mind, but also knowing that I wanted to play solo trumpet. I love playing solo trumpet. I've done a few improvised concerts where it's just myself and solo trumpet. The tune starts out with myself playing solo trumpet.

<p>
	<br>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Tone Madison: Was there any particular reason why you put together a group with the lineup of bass, drums, trumpet and bass clarinet? It's definitely unusual to have trumpet and bass clarinet be the only two horn instruments.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Russ Johnson: </strong>Yeah, there aren't too many recordings with that. For me it's all about musical personalities. I'm on a lot of records that are trumpet and some kind of saxophone and bass and drums. I'm known to do that. I'm on probably, I don't know off the top of my head, 12 records that feature that lineup. One of the thing that's amazing about the Chicago musicians is that their strengths are not necessarily mine, so I wanted to pick musicians who would push me as an improviser, and for me it was all about Jason's musical personality. Before I moved to Milwaukee, I did a lot of research and bought a lot of records of Chicago guys, so I went into this project knowing I wanted these three guys. I'm very much a project-oriented composer and musician. I rarely compose in general terms just to sit down and write. I usually have a project or a goal in mind. So for me, the lineup with bass clarinet was more about Jason Stein's personality than the fact that he happens to play bass clarinet. And honestly, I love the way the two instruments sound together. The bass clarinet has a four-octave range—some people can play almost five octaves on it. So as a composer, that allows you quite a bit more flexibility, because you can work with a different range.

</iframe>
<p>
	<br>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Tone Madison: And in addition to the range of notes, it's also got this weird range of sounds, where it can be really pretty and fluid or kind of low and guttural.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Russ Johnson: </strong>I don't really like the term “extended techniques," but Jason is able to create more sounds on that instrument than just about anybody I've heard. He's a master of manipulating texture.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: You mentioned writing with goals in mind—were there any particular experiences or ideas that influenced how you wrote the songs on <em>Meeting Point</em>?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Russ Johnson:</strong> The title came about, because for me it was moving from New York to Chicago, and they're different scenes. I have a certain compositional style. We all have our loves when we write. I like beautiful melodies. I'm often thought of as an avant-garde or new-music trumpeter, but I actually really love playing a beautiful melody. So when I was writing that music, I was writing for those three individuals, so I was trying to write what I perceived their strengths to be. They all knew me before I moved to the area but we hadn't had any musical interaction before. I'd listened to a bunch of their recordings, so I tailored the compositional bent of the recording to fit my musical aesthetic, but also to really embrace theirs, so that we could find common ground or a musical—this is terrible—a musical meeting point that we could explore together. I feel like playing with those guys has pushed me in a way, but I also feel like I may have pushed them in a way that they don't normally play. Which is growth as a musician. I'm all about that.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: What do you like about playing with Johannes Wallmann?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Russ Johnson:</strong> He has a way of composing music that sometimes is deceptive, in that it may sound traditional in a way, but there is always something in there that's a challenge.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: And that's something you have in common, right?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Russ Johnson: </strong>Sure, I would consider him a kindred spirit in that way for sure.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: And you're both working in academic jobs but also don't want to be walled off inside academia.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Russ Johnson: </strong>I think that's incredibly important. Johannes is a very strong academic. I started teaching four and a half years ago, and I commuted from New York for a year and a half to teach in Kenosha. But I think it's important and respect Johannes tremendously for being out there as a player. The reason I applied for the job at Parkside was I knew it would allow me to pursue my performance career. When your students see you out there doing it, they are inspired. And for me as a musician, and I'm not trying to speak for Johannes but I'm sure he's the same way, our performance career is such a vital part of who we are as musicians that I think it enhances our teaching, and I think it's important that we feed that side of our personalities.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: Getting back to the Dolphy project, what did you find were the most challenging pieces to interpret?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Russ Johnson: </strong>I wanted to honor the spirit of it. I was very hesitant to do it. The label was willing to do it, and that's one of the reasons we recorded it. I almost exclusively play original music. I don't often go out and just do a gig of standards. But again, it's the players and personalities. I don't know if you know the pianist on that record, Myra Melford, but she is unbelievable. There's vibraphone on the original record, but I didn't want it to be exactly the same. I transcribed the charts, so they're actual transcriptions of what's on the original record. I didn't do anything to the arrangements. I didn't mess with them, because I wanted to study the compositions, and Eric Dolphy at that point was writing music that was chamber music. I really feel like he was writing chamber music. But as far as the improvisations, on the original recording sometimes they're trying to stick to certain forms, and other times they're just letting the forms go. To me the spirit of that original recording is of taking chances. All of the improvisational sections on that are completely improvised. I transcribed some of the things Richard Davis played and told Brad Jones, the bass player, “some of this could happen or may not happen."

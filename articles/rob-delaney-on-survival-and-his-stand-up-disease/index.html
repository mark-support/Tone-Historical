      <p>
	Rob Delaney's comedy thrives on both crass abandon and a sense of something hard-won. On his 2012 stand-up album <em>Live At The Bowery Ballroom</em>, Delaney plows through bits about the gross/weird aspects of marriage and child-rearing, deviant sex acts, and contracting hepatitis from a contaminated cake, all with a delivery that's consistently quick and flip but also vivid and self-aware enough that it doesn't wear thin. As he's grown more popular he's also spoken openly about his previous struggles with alcoholism and depression (<a href="http://mentalpod.com/Rob-Delaney-podcast" target="_blank">his appearance on the <em>Mental Illness Happy Hour</em> podcast</a> is a good primer), published the 2013 book <em>Rob Delaney: Mother. Wife. Sister. Human. Warrior. Falcon. Yardstick. Turban. Cabbage.</em>, and developed a <a href="http://twitter.com/robdelaney" target="_blank">Twitter account</a> that veers off in another direction entirely. (Yes, it's been said a lot that he's something of a master at Twitter, but his feed is indeed a <a href="https://twitter.com/robdelaney/status/558696149406998528" target="_blank">merciless</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/robdelaney/status/550049269944975360" target="_blank">hail</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/robdelaney/status/511633881981022208" target="_blank">sharply</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/robdelaney/status/564534249756585985" target="_blank">crafted</a>, demented anecdotes and <a href="https://twitter.com/robdelaney/status/561183231954137088" target="_blank">grade-A corporate-account trolling</a>.)
</p>
<p>
	Recently Delaney has been in the U.K. launching the British series <em>Catastrophe</em>, which he co-writes and co-stars in with collaborator Sharon Horgan. Delaney talked with us as he finished up <em>Catastrophe</em>'s first season and prepared for a run of U.S. dates he's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_ROr21PbzU" target="_blank">dubbed the "Meat" tour</a>, which includes a show <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/909225122429166/" target="_blank">this Saturday at the Barrymore</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: How is the UK treating you? Have you been getting in a balance of stand-up and working on <em data-redactor-tag="em">Catastrophe</em>?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Rob Delaney:</strong> I do stand-up, too, but yeah, the main thing is making this show. Today is the last day of editing the first season, and then I'll come back to the U.S. just for a little bit and do some dates, and then go back to England to start writing the second season.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: How has your stand-up set been evolving since <em data-redactor-tag="em">Live At The Bowery Ballroom</em>? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Rob Delaney: </strong>Well, I don't do any of that stuff anymore, as fun as it was to do. I'm older, I have more grey hair, I don't think I'm fatter, because now that I live in the U.K. it's a little harder to eat just buckets of grey and beige food, and also I don't have a car here and don't drive. I'd like to tell you that I'm fatter, but I don't think I am. But I have more children now. When that album came out I had one kid, and now I have two, and my wife is about to have a third, so our lives are much more difficult, and as such I'm much more angry and afraid, so it's a pretty good recipe for better comedy. My need to be on stage is stronger now, so I hit harder, and I'm more comfortable and confident and all that. It's just deeper. The disease is worse in me now, I guess, the need to do stand-up.

</iframe>
<p>
	<br>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Would you say those changes in your life are making the stand-up more urgent or more personal? I mean, your stand-up already draws a lot on your personal life, but there's also a bit of a persona mixed in with that.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Rob Delaney:</strong> Yeah, I mean I know more about life now. I care more about things. My capacity to be happier is greater. My capacity to be angry is greater. When you survive two adulthoods, you've got some good habits that got you there and also some bad ones. For me, a sense of humor is so essential to survival, and the older you get the more pain you feel and funny things you see. Endurance is a big one, too. I just feel like an old, dependable, ugly horse who might not be your first choice, but while the amazing stallion might get tired after a short burst, I can get you down and up the other side of the canyon. It won't be sexy, but we'll get there. You might have to shoot me at the end of it, but I will get you to the other side. That's sort of how I feel now.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: In interviews you've been pretty open about your previous life in having a professional career and problems with alcohol. Have you found yourself digging deeper into that part of your life in your work too?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Rob Delaney: </strong>The earlier part, like before I got sober and stuff? I don't really talk about that too much anymore, just because being married and being a parent is really, really fascinating and cool, and the eyes that I look at the world through now are, I don't know, more understanding, empathetic, fatigued. I kind of enjoy my perspective more than I did the one I had back then. Going through that stuff, it's so familiar to me. I've talked about that stuff so much. Again, I wouldn't trade it for a second, and I'm grateful for it, and I learned so much and it made me who I am now, but there's a certain amount I feel like I can say about getting sober or depression or stuff like that, and I feel like I'm just even barely scratching the surface of things like adult relationships, raising kids, and really relating to the world in a sort of enduring way.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Is it a challenge to juggle all the different fronts that you work on, from the stand-up to the show to the personality you have on Twitter? Do they all fuel or inform each other in some way?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Rob Delaney: </strong>Yeah. You know, Twitter has made everybody kind of look at smaller individual units of language and the value of individual words and stuff. I think for dialogue and the appreciation of just actual words and vocabulary, Twitter's actually been really helpful. I imagined I was gonna start by saying, “Yeah, I don't really think about Twitter in terms of all those things," but in fact, I do think it is good for the word-lover, and that can inform some of the longer things I write, because Twitter has actually made me fell deeper in love with the English language. You know, the book is pretty unvarnished who I am, what I think, and stand-up is a little bit of a heightened sort of attitude, approach, persona, but you can tell who I am and what I want to talk about and what I care about. I might get angry at an idea in stand-up that doesn't actually make me go insane in real life, but I do enjoy diving deep into a topic and extrapolating. I don't think the audience would ever think that I'm really going to murder somebody over a parking spot, but it can be fun to talk about it in graphic detail.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: In balancing all those different fronts, what have been some of the most enjoyable or interesting challenges for you over the past few years?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Rob Delaney:</strong> Well, this show, <em>Catastrophe</em>, that I've been doing here—right now, even though I know we're doing a second season, it's physically painful to sign off this afternoon on the final afternoon of the first season, because we worked so hard on it and pulled no punches—this is the hardest I've ever worked on anything. It was nice to have a partner to do it with, because we were able to inspire each other to higher heights and strip away any dishonesty or useless stuff and make it as pure as possible. This show is definitely the thing I'm proudest of by a wide margin. And it was fun to work with a partner, whereas writing the first draft of the book wasn't fun. The revisions of the book were fun, after I kind of knew what the book was, but every aspect of writing and filming and editing a show has been fun.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Is it refreshing to be kind of immersed in a more collaborative project after spending so much time in stand-up, which has a more solitary nature?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Rob Delaney: </strong>No, nothing is more fun than stand-up. I have nothing but good stuff to say about stand-up, doing it, performing it, consuming it. Totally crazy about stand-up. Doing something with a partner, though, I did enjoy it much more than writing a book and much more than any article or kind of nonsense that I do on my own, with the exception of stand-up. Because stand-up, you're not alone. You're with an audience, and woe unto the comedian who doesn't think that that audience is more important than they are in the equation. You can't do stand-up in a closet.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Is there any particular reason you're calling these upcoming U.S. tours your “Meat Tour"?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Rob Delaney: </strong>In the material I'm doing, I do talk about meat. Meat is involved in a few jokes. It wasn't like I was like, “Yes, I must address meat, and the theme of the tour is meat." Its just literally I was trying to think of a name for it, and I was like, “Hey, don't I talk about meat a few times? There you go!" And I think that's as good of a reason as any.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: How did your <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/06/celebrities-parody-camerons-on-the-phone-to-obama-selfie-tweet" target="_blank">Twitter flirtation with Patrick Stewart</a> pan out?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Rob Delaney: </strong>You know, it's funny. We actually met recently. He and his wife Sunny and me and my wife went out to dinner recently, and that was just unbelievably fun. A really kind, sweet, brilliant guy. So that was pretty groovy.

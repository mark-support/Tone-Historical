    <article>
      <p>Madison-based artist&nbsp;<a href="http://chrisormitch.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Chris Maddox</a>’s show<a href="http://www.union.wisc.edu/wud/event.asp?event_id=25481" target="_blank"> <em>Terra Obscura: Works On Paper</em>, up at Union South’s Gallery 1308 through Jan. 27</a>, might seem prim and understated at first glance, as most of the works draw on the forms of maps and scientific charts and use colors meticulously sourced from old atlases. But within those constraints, Maddox, an MFA candidate at UW-Madison, is doing something more playful and even destructive, questioning the comfort, authority, and rationality we find in maps of a geologically and politically changing world, or in charts that neatly corral data relating to complex scientific and social questions. For one piece, "Ghost,"&nbsp;Maddox took an old map of Wisconsin and scraped off most of the ink, leaving behind a faint impression and a set of 72 vials of the ink remnants—one for each of Wisconsin’s counties. In another, "Three Great Floods With Watermarks,"&nbsp;he uses simple blue-green charts to look at changing sea levels, from both scientific and religious perspectives. Another set of 10 works plays with different forms of charts and graphs that attempt to rationalize and categorize everything from mundane human activities to a free-jazz performance. Maddox met up with me at Gallery 1308 recently to talk about some of the works.</p><p><strong>
Tone Madison: One of these pieces, “Le Matin des Noire,” from the "Ten Bookplates" series,&nbsp;refers to the free-jazz artist Archie Shepp. What exactly does it have to do with Shepp’s work?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Chris Maddox: </strong>The title is the title of one of his songs. It translates to “the morning of darkness.” I thought that was an interesting thing because that’s something that has a double meaning that is kind of mysterious, in the same way that all of these charts have a second layer, or kind of a secondary abstraction that pits it against rational thinking and science. So there’s this layer of meaning in his title and sort of overlapping my two-sided world with his two-sided world. It’s a beginning of thinking about, for me, projecting or translating the notion of what a map is to other forms. So in this case, a musical chart can be a map, and it expresses in a way the irony of the un-chart-ability of free jazz, which is a formless form, and yet not. It’s built upon something internalized versus something that can be mapped. The idea is to open a can of worms with this piece and kind of blow your mind with all the tangents you can go on, thinking about what it might mean to draw a visual representation of this that’s not rational or analyze-able. I have a personal connection to jazz music because I studied it for years and became aware of how this form of music, which evolved naturally and in the wild of sorts of New Orleans and New York City, it was not something that was rationalized and wasn’t something that began in an academic world or on paper. It happened dynamically and by accidents and things. I’m kind of pitting that against science and the idea of mapping territories. It’s a territory that can’t be mapped and yet somebody did, and they kind of took the life out of it when they turned this form of music into something that they mapped and could teach in colleges. They’re really not teaching jazz the way it happened and existed in the '30s through the '60s. This kind of represents the end of that era and sort of a transition where people did start to academicize the form, and that happens to all really great art forms. They have a period of time where they’re highly innovative and important, and just become institutionalized and all of a sudden become something that needs to be usurped.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qQRDFltSO0k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe><p>
	<br>The lines in the graphic are actually a re-purposing of a color chart from a map. Shepp talks in an interview that I read about this transition from bebop and hard jazz, which have a very documentable form and a a vertical form if you were to come up with one word that would encompass the structure of the music and the theoretical basis of soloing in jazz, and he talks about how John Coltrane brought it to a linear form, and it’s not about working on these harmonies but it’s about working with this melody and re-inventing it along this horizontal line. So the thing’s built of horizontal and vertical lines running against each other, and it’s just sort of a visual representation of that,</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: There’s a piece of sheet music crumpled up in the corner of the work, and it seems as if you’re discarding it with pleasure.</strong></p><p><strong>
	Chris Maddox:</strong> Yeah, and there’s a note there, and it’s probably not very readable. There’s a map to John Coltrane’s apartment. I transcribed an interview where Shepp talks about his first meeting with John Coltrane, where he had stalked him in a club and gotten his address and came by the next morning. It’s a great little story, so I just wrote the whole story out, and then I just crumpled it up along with the sheet music and crammed them in the bottom corner of the piece.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: Another piece in the same series with the Shepp piece has a legend that includes factors like “drinking punch” and “stalling.” What’s that about?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Chris Maddox: </strong>It’s a diagram or a chart of the futility of trying to map the future. The lines, each represented by a color and weight and pattern and standing for one of these actions, it’s just showing that if you were trying to track from the present to some future time—it’s sort of a joke but not. I sort of take seriously my philosophical reactions to speculative science and projections. It’s poking fun at the futility of trying to simulate a future that doesn’t exist yet. And yet, with some reverence, because I understand and appreciate the importance of being able to plan for the future.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: In a lot of these pieces there’s clearly some rational system of presenting information at work, but it’s usually not obvious what exactly you’re building off of.</strong></p><p><strong>
	Chris Maddox:</strong> Which is really deliberate. You’re meant to be a little bit confused and accept that and begin to develop your own sort of story. But there’s enough specificity that you can build with something. It’s not a blank page. Some are fairly direct and process-driven. These color charts are literally the colors that were printed on a specific page of an atlas. I’ve just been collecting the atlases or referencing them in the cartography libraries on campus. I have a system where I’ll identify the dominant color on one page and then systematically determine the exact Pantone process color makeup of the color.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: What got you interested in atlases as a source of color?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Chris Maddox: </strong>Taking a little bit of the subjectivity of making a piece and just giving myself rules and letting the outcome be dictated partially by rationality than by creative whimsy. I’m playing with rational content, so the more I use it in making decisions, the more disturbingly authoritative it feels and the more authentically like published information it feels, so I’m playing around with some of these games of production and of publishing data on an academic side. Not the kind of data you might see in <em>US News And World Report</em>, where it’s for mass consumption.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: And in your artist statement, you bring up the question of how definitive a map can really be, when the geology it represents is always gradually changing.</strong></p><p><strong>
	Chris Maddox:</strong> I’m fascinated by the fact that what a geographic or political map depicts feels concrete and is not questioned as a temporary representation. I’ve got a globe from when I was a kid that has countries that don’t exist anymore on it. It still feels legitimate. it feels like factual information, and it’s actually kind of a myth based on the past. I think boundaries that depict water—water is in constant flux, and they’re just signifiers. There’s a river in this general area. There’s a lake covering roughly this area. The ocean’s roughly here. But the shoreline is never in the exact same spot twice—even as a day cycles through, it’s somewhat different. We have to understand that those approximations are approximations in order to function, but there’s this implication that there are times when we’re taking things for granted when we shouldn’t.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: Another piece here, "Ghost," is a map of Wisconsin that you’ve removed most of the ink from. Have you been getting a lot of interesting responses to that?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Chris Maddox: </strong>Yeah, not as much as  I might have expected. I had a review with my committee here night for my degree, and it was the best conversation I’ve had about it yet. It begs a lot of questions and it’s probably the inspiration for ending my statement with the idea that I’m posing rhetorical questions. There’s definitely an intention that rather than this being a squarely or specific, singular lesson of a piece—it’s meant to feel didactic, but you kind of have to come up with your own message and lesson and meaning from it. And I think that seems to be how people perceive it and experience it. They understand that they’re supposed to create some meaning.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: And then next to the map, you’ve got the removed ink in vials that are divided up by county. What made you decide to do that?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Chris Maddox:</strong> It’s partly because the map I was working with was a political map showing the counties, and I also felt that that was a bit ironic, because it was labeled as a map of vegetation, what grows where in the state, but not a highly detailed one. It showed where marshes were and where forests were and things like that. The content of the map really spoke of natural resources without being really loaded with information. I believed that a map divided into counties created these little identities or brand icons in this image that people from a particular county would relate to strongly. It’s more of a sense of home. I don’t feel a sense of ownership of the whole state of Wisconsin, especially as diverse as it is in political views. But if I see Dane County on this map, and see that there’s a vial filled with the ashes, if you will, or the spill resources of my county, I may take a little more ownership of that and feel more personally connected to the work through this juxtaposition of my home and this larger space. It’s also about creating this false sense of equality. [In the chart that accompanies the vials], you see every county depicted as the exact same size, and I tried to make each vial the same visual weight, even though some of them are actually twice as big as others. There’s a message about the dumbing-down of society when you try to say everything is equal, when in fact the counties are not equal in terms of the resources that are taken or extracted, or how they’re used or why. Some are resources more for the population within them, and some are useful because we take frac sand out of them.</p><p>
	I wanted to leave enough evidence of what it was for people to not be confused about the authenticity of the source. It was an actual printed map. I left things that were specifically cueing naturally resources, like the little marshland swamp icons and streams, and there’s a few words here and there—I left a lot of river ways, because I felt like the rivers are a signifier of a lifeline. I left this little area that says “hills.” It’s kind of generalized. I left part of the word “Michigan” to select “ich,” which is German for “I,” as a signifier of a kind of self-centeredness or a lack of foresight, in the way that we utilize the landscape.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: How did you create the video piece in the exhibit, "Prelude And Fugue"?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Chris Maddox: </strong>I have this little collection of videos I’ve shot from airplanes. These were lo-fi short clips that have been remixed into this thing that takes the moments I’ve had in flying that have led to the inspiration to dig into this subject and remixes them as a way to retell the piece that’s opposite them. The piece divides the world up into mountain land, wilderness, urban development, and agricultural development. I depict those four topographies through this in different ways. The idea was to show where it all began, really, and to show another way that the world is signified. A big part of this is pointing at maps and data visualizations as, they can be false idols for an academic, they can be crutches for a traveler to create a false sense of familiarity for a place or a false sense of security in finding your way. There’s nothing like looking at the world directly. Here’s one way to look at the world, and here’s the world—isn’t that kind of fucked-up?</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: And the video piece is something that’s messy and complex, as opposed to the neat and tidy forms you’re working with in the print pieces.</strong></p><p><strong>
	Chris Maddox:</strong> I love the contrast of that, the fact that the real world is so much less clean and polished. We feel like this [the video] is closer to reality than these [the map/chart-oriented works] are, but it’s not. It’s light bouncing of a wall from a projector, and it’s just another signifier of the world. I’ve done all kinds of manipulations, speeding things up, slowing them down, converting things to black and white, which signifies a dream version of reality.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: Some of the shots have a ripple-y, distorted quality. is that deliberate or just a product of them being lo-fi videos shot through plane windows?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Chris Maddox: </strong>It was an effect that I found by accident and used deliberately. I kind of refer to that as something like a discovery of the fallacy of the recorded image. I’m deliberately making you aware of the fakeness of the image you’re seeing on the wall here, as another way of playing with the unreal side of everything and the representative side.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: The three pieces that accompany the video—"Where The Wild Things Were," "Compression," and "Three Great Floods With Watermarks"—bring us back around to some of those ideas about projecting the future and playing with the forms of atlases.</strong></p><p><strong>
	Chris Maddox:</strong> The first piece represents land topographies in the original source, and they’re meant to confuse a little bit, but they’re built with actual data and actual math, and I had pages of notes where I figured things out, and I included some of those on this piece. I just felt compelled to bring it on to this as a handwritten layer. They’re all following a set of rules. There are some design parameters. Each one is a depiction of the past, present, and future. Each one involves a kind of religious zeal of belief or faith in the data or information. The one on the far right shows a Biblical flood depiction; our present and very knowable world with a reference to the tsunami that hit Sri Lanka and Thailand in 2004 as a kind of present-day version of a megaflood; and then the future, which is again a mythology but it’s a different beliefs system. It’s the ideology of science pitted against the ideology of Christianity, or many religions.</p>

      <h2>After seven years performing and nurturing stand-up comedy in Madison, Schmidt is heading to L.A.</h2>

    <article>
      <p>Seven years ago,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/schmidtmypants" target="_blank">Mike Schmidt</a> was a criminal-defense lawyer trying stand-up comedy for the first time, and Madison wasn’t nearly as good a town for local or touring stand-ups as it is today. The first time Schmidt told jokes onstage, it was at an open mic at The Klinic, which was a truly terrible place on South Park Street. But, like many other local comics, he deserves credit for organizing shows and performing in the dive spots that would have them, then later helping to make the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.madisoncomedy.com/the-big-deuce/" target="_blank">Wednesday-night open mic at the Comedy Club On State</a> a success. </p><p>Over the years Schmidt has developed an a ruthlessly efficient way with one-liners, often flirting with the dark and sick but really depending on timing and conciseness for his laughs. For instance, consider the quintessential Mike Schmidt bit: “When I was a child I thought that the word racist meant that you like to see cars go fast. I got older, I'm like, 'That's not what a racist is.' I got older still, I'm like, 'Oh, snap, that's <em>exactly</em> what a racist is.'"</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DYn63ziVfpg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><br>Making Madison a better comedy town was of course a group effort: While Schmidt was getting good, so were many other local comics, and several venues and promoters were massively stepping up the amount of good touring comedy that comes to Madison. But Schmidt always seemed like the one in the local comedy crowd who’s had it most together. Maybe it was the lawyer thing, or the sharp sweaters, or the deadpan stage presence, or his efforts to make the Comedy Club’s open mic welcoming as it attracted more audience members and first-time comics. Earlier this year, Schmidt also spent a few months working for the Comedy Club and the Orpheum, helping to book the club and organize the first Madison Comedy Festival. </p><p>Schmidt is planning to move to L.A. soon, dealing local comedy a big loss but still leaving it in a much-improved state. His fellow Madison comics will be sending him off&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/788985011158569" target="_blank">with a roast on December 22 at the Argus</a>. Ahead of the move, Schmidt met up to talk about his next steps and the perspective he’s gained on telling jokes and working with other comics. </p><p><strong>Tone Madison: So why the move?</strong></p><p><strong>Mike Schmidt:</strong> There’s really nothing for me here anymore. In terms of trying to get on bigger and bigger stages, there aren’t that many bigger stages. Chicago’s kind of insular. You have to be in Chicago if you want to get anywhere in Chicago. Minneapolis is five hours away. There’s nine clubs in the ti-state area, and there’s more than that in Los Angeles. I’ve looked at the L.A. scene, and it’s more disorganized than in Madison or Chicago, but the booking model is a little bit different because it’s easier to get on stage at a lot of different places, because it’s not a one-two-three, MC-feature-headliner. It’s more of a showcase format, with about seven comedians filling the same amount of time, and they’re doing more shows more days of the week in more places. </p><p><strong>Tone Madison: And in the Midwest you’ve been able to get a lot of resort gigs and casino gigs, but is that not what you’re after anymore?</strong></p><p><strong>Mike Schmidt: </strong>No, I like those. Those are some of the most fun that I’ve ever had. I’m banned from doing karaoke in a lot of small-town bars for what I’ve done after those shows. Those are some of the most fun that you’ll ever have, if you approach it with the right attitude. St. Cloud, Minnesota, and Sault Ste. Marie, just amazing towns, especially if you go at the beginning of winter right before the snow hits, when there’s nothing to do, the whole town will come out and it’s truly an experience that you should not miss. </p><p><strong>Tone Madison: When did you get to the point where you were really convinced it was time to move on?</strong></p><p><strong>Mike Schmidt: </strong>Oh, like three or four years ago. There’s just limited opportunities for advancement in the Midwest. Think of it like king of the hill. This is a very small hill, and Chicago is a good-sized hill, but anyone who can climb to the top of Chicago still has to, when they arrive in New York, start at the bottom, so how many hills are you gonna climb in your life? Because all the hills here in the Midwest don’t count, according to New York and Los Angeles. </p><p><strong>Tone Madison: What have been some of the positives for you in doing comedy here for a long time?</strong></p><p><strong>Mike Schmidt: </strong>Well, we got to take Madison comedy from a group of about eight or 10 dedicated locals to about 50 or 60 local comedians, so we grew it by 100 percent several years in a row into what it is now. And I really enjoy helping talent develop and getting them stage time and teaching them proper MCing technique. People who can be funny onstage are few and far between, and that can’t really be taught. It can be refined. But good MCing technique can be taught—just how to project your voice, how to hold the microphone, what order to do the introductions in, what order to put your jokes in. I liked being able to help the MCs develop and then help them get gigs in other cities. A lot of them got to do MCing and guest spots at Jokerz in Milwaukee, and progressed to featuring at Jokerz because of the training we supplied for them in Madison. </p><p><strong>Tone Madison: Are there any comedians in particular here who you’ve really bonded with, or who have surprised you with their growth and improvement?</strong></p><p><strong>Mike Schmidt:</strong> I would say, of the people that are still doing it, I’m most impressed with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/antoniocomedy" target="_blank">Antonio Aguilar</a> because he understands the nature of the business and is constantly hustling to get himself gigs. He’s really working the road well and getting to a lot of places. In terms of artistic development, the most recent one I would say is&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/oswolfe" target="_blank">Toler Wolfe</a>. He’s fantastic. He does some mixed-media jokes where there’s soundtrack overlay, but it’s not the musical cue that you’re probably hoping it isn’t. It’s a second layer. It’s almost like a commentary track on his joke. It’s like you get to see his set and you get to listen to the director’s commentary at the same time, which can be hilarious. It’s like he’s doing a two-man act with himself.</p><p><strong>Tone Madison: In the time you’ve been doing comedy, how do you think you’ve evolved? </strong></p><p><strong>Mike Schmidt:</strong> Well, when I started, I bought a book called <em>The Comedy Bible</em>, which is absolutely terrible. Two years before that, somebody had bought me a copy of that book, and I read it, and it gave me the worst advice that I’ve ever had. And thankfully, I never went onstage armed with just what I had learned from that book, or I probably would have drowned myself in a river. Everyone has a favorite comedian. I always loved George Carlin, but it turned out when I started writing jokes that I would come off as preachy in the tone of my voice, and long-form jokes just really weren’t my thing. So I tended more towards one-liners, because I liked Warren Zevon and I liked the rhythm and the pacing and the quick turns, and the ability to toy with the audience and mess with them and keep them coming at them quickly, so that if they don’t like a joke I can make it worse for them, and then worse for them, until they start to love it.&nbsp;</p><p>But one-liners are hard to write over and over and over again, because once you write enough of them, you start to realize that there’s just a couple of shifts that people use. Like “This is a sentence that if you read it at the beginning, it sounds like they’re using the first definition of a word in the dictionary, but they’re actually using the second most common definition for this word—oh, ha ha ha.” And it’s fun and it’s great. Attitudinal shifts are, “It sounds like he’s for or against something, but then as he goes on I realize that it’s the opposite, or even something completely different.” Fun! But it’s hard to keep those up, so you have a choice between getting more weird and getting more normal. I did a lot of things that were a lot more weird. A ventriloquist puppet that was just a flashlight. I brought in kazoos and had people play them. I’ve done a lot of really stupid things, but that’s sort of governed by what a club will let you get away with. Some clubs don’t let me fly my freak flag, but some of them, like Jokers in Milwaukee, let me do whatever I want. Threaten people with knives and stuff. Just kidding. So in terms of me changing, I would say I wanted to write long political jokes, I realized that no one would want to hear them, so then I wrote short jokes, and once I wrote a lot of short jokes, I figured out that a long joke is really just a lot of short jokes strung together.</p><p><strong>Tone Madison: Let’s go back to this Warren Zevon thing for a minute. What is it about him that inspired you?</strong></p><p><strong>Mike Schmidt:</strong> Well, before I ever got onstage for the first time, I was trying to write these jokes based on <em>The Comedy Bible</em> that were just terrible. So, take a topic. Give me a topic.</p><p><strong>Tone Madison: Um, candles. [<em>There was a candle on the table and apparently I have no imagination whatsoever—ed.</em>]</strong></p><p><strong>Mike Schmidt: </strong>So [according to <em>The Comedy Bible</em>] I’m supposed to say what is weird, funny, scary, or stupid about candles. And that’s supposed to be how I should write jokes to keep people enthralled for 10 to 45 minutes. It’s a terrible, terrible way to write jokes. Letting them happen more naturally and having a more creative state of play is a lot better. But those were the only jokes that I had any idea about how to write, and they were shit. And then one day I was listening to “Werewolves Of London,” and it goes, “I saw a werewolf drinking a pina colada at Trader Vic’s/ his hair was perfect.” But the rhythm of it is the exact same rhythm as “Take my wife—please,” or “I just flew in from Cleveland, and boy are my arms tired.” And that’s when I realized that one-liners, and most jokes, are way more rhythmic than people give them credit for. There’s a belief that all stand-up comedians wish they could be lead singers, and it’s a little bit true. Part of us being stand-up comedians is because we can’t keep five people together—we couldn’t wrangle a drummer. We can’t scare up a bass player enough to practice. So we have to go in on our own, but it is a performance art. So what you wear, how you move your body, and how you pause and raise your voice and quiet your voice, just like in a song, gives additional meaning and additional force to the statements. Realizing that it’s rhythmic lets you write just scads. I think I have like 400 one-liners, just written off knowing that it’s rhythmic. It’s kind of like Shakespeare in a very, very truckstop-bathroom way.</p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/iDpYBT0XyvA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><br><strong>Tone Madison: And with that line from “Werewolves Of London,” there’s also that bit of misdirection, and of course you’re into that, for instance in your joke about wasting water. </strong></p><p><strong>Mike Schmidt: </strong>Right. There is a werewolf. He is drinking a froo-froo drink at a trendy sort of luau-culture bar—IN ENGLAND—and keep in mind that a werewolf is an unnatural, killing beast that can only be harmed by silver, and eats people, and sheds his skin, and can regenerate, and is allergic to wolfsbane which no one even knows what that is, but what does he choose to point out? Yeah, his hair, because that was the most remarkable thing about this werewolf. You realize that this is a man who sees werewolves all the time, and he’s seen big ones and little ones and seen them eating old women, and now he’s seen one, and his hair is perfect. And that to me is comedy. </p><p><strong>Tone Madison: In your time doing comedy stuff here, what kinds of interactions have you had with the touring comics that come through?</strong></p><p><strong>Mike Schmidt: </strong>Basically, everybody on their way up is really, really nice. And every now and again you run into somebody who’s on their way down, or never got what they felt what they were owed, and they are monsters. Every comedian that you would think is a complete asshole based on their stage persona is a kitty-cat, and some of the guys where you think, “Oh, he’s down-home, he’s folksy, oh, isn’t he smart,” is a prick. I won’t name names.</p><p><strong>Tone Madison: In addition to performing, you’ve spent a lot of time hosting and organizing open-misc and other comedy events. How has that affected you? It does seem like work that can make a person jaded. </strong></p><p><strong>Mike Schmidt: </strong>It hasn’t changed me that much. I think one of the reasons why I was good at it and why I was able to get so many more comedians to come out regularly was because I don’t believe in writing off someone because they’re awkward offstage, or because they’re not dressed correctly, or because they don’t know how to behave themselves when they first get into a new social situation. Those are all things that either you learn or you’re born with, not your fault. The worst crime for me was if someone was mean to someone who was new. That’s something that I would not tolerate, and when people were that way, I did my best to run them off, because those people scare away new blood. And if you notice, it’s a hobby, and it’s a dream for people, but they don’t all stick with it. Of everyone that I started with, there are two left:&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mrdavidfisher" target="_blank">David Fisher</a> and Nick Lynch. Everyone else has given up on it, doesn’t tell jokes on stage anymore, or has moved really far away. So it needs a constant infusion of new blood. And for that to work, it needs to be a welcoming atmosphere, because you can’t really tell who’s going to be hilarious onstage based on anything other than how funny they are onstage. Everyone gets a chance, and everyone gets a second chance and everyone gets a third chance. </p><p><strong>Tone Madison: The thing that’s really striking about stand-up is the endurance that it takes: There’s a lot of waiting involved if you do an open mic, and a lot of people have to be tenacious for years to get good at it.</strong></p><p><strong>Mike Schmidt: </strong>Well, a lot of people say that it’s the only art that you have to practice in front of a crowd, which is true. The first time I ever went to an open mic, it was at The Klinic on Park Street, which is now gone. Chris Waelti and Adam Waldron ran it, and I got there hours in advance and just sat there and waited, and other people just sat there and waited, and then eventually the show started, and afterwards, if you did well people talked to you, and if you didn’t people kind of ignored you. That was something that I didn’t like, so enforcing strict start times and making sure everyone plays nice I think helped foster the scene. But really, when you do a show in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and it’s Thanksgiving weekend, you drive somewhere knowing there’s probably not going to be that many people there, but hoping against hope, like Abraham dragging his son up to the mountain, that something’s going to make this OK, something’s going to make this not a complete shit-show. But you go, and it is what you make of it. Usually the crowds are smaller than you would have anticipated. Someone says, “Oh, well this never happens, normally we’re busier than this.” And then you’re sitting in your hotel room waiting for the show, and then not a lot of people show up and you do it, and then you’re alone in a town where you don’t know anybody, and then you have to sit there, and you drink at bar or you go back to your hotel room. And then the next day you just sit in your hotel room and wait to do it again, not really knowing anyone, seeing what’s on the Internet. And at the end of it, your reward is they pay you, you’re fired for the year, you can’t stay the next week, and then you drive home eight hours by yourself. So yeah, it’s a lonely undertaking, and we worked to strip everything that was lonely about it out that we could, because it doesn’t have to be that way.</p><p><strong>Tone Madison: The Klinic! That place was fucking weird.</strong></p><p><strong>Mike Schmidt: </strong>We used to play a game—Chris Waelti was the scorekeeper—called “did Mike get rid of the dead mouse yet?” Because there was a guy named Mike who owned the place, and every week we would go and look for the dead mouse in the back corner by the window. This place is now a Pizza Hut. And if the dead mouse was still there, we announced it onstage and celebrated. We never told the owner where the dead mouse was. We just kind of understood that if you clean your place you should find this one, because it’s out in the fucking open. He never did. I believe the score was 37 to zero because he never found the dead mouse. And there was another dead mouse, and then the bar went under and then shut down. </p><p><strong>Tone Madison: There’s been a lot of different comedy open-misc around town over the years and they’ve all been a bit different. What’s been the most interesting one for you? </strong></p><p><strong>Mike Schmidt: </strong>The most interesting is the open mic at the Comedy Club On State, because that is rare for an open-mic to have that many normal people. The overwhelming majority of the audience at that open mic is not comedians. It’s an attendance of 150 or 200 people, for an open mic, which is unheard of pretty much anywhere. That allows the people a freedom to try new things. An all-comedian open mic is a whole bunch of people either grudgingly laughing, wishing they wrote that joke themselves, or wishing that you would quit. So, what makes most open mic bad? The comedians in the audience. Whether comedians are unconsciously playing to the other comedians at the open mic, or there’s just not enough laughter for a critical mass, the thing that makes open mics bad are the comedians in the audience.&nbsp;</p><p>The open mic at the Comedy Club works because the comedians know they can do or say anything in a club with a real audience, so they don’t have to worry about getting banned for saying something bad, they just have to worry about not getting laughs. It frees them up to be a lot more creative. We work with them on technical aspects, if they need music piped in or a voice-over done or lighting cues, they get that. When it started, we had to come up with a whole bunch of interstitials to keep it alive because there were only eight or 10 of us and we didn’t have enough comedians to fill the roster. Thankfully, open-micers started showing up in droves, but getting them to stay and getting the crowd to stay was a little bit difficult. We had to make sure that the show was consistently funny, but we didn’t have enough consistently funny people, because we just didn’t have enough people who had done it very many times. When people invite their friends out to watch them do comedy for the first time, I want to make sure that that person has a good time, and I want to make sure that their friends have a good time. Because if their friends are anything like them, they might also be thinking about doing it, and they might just be better than this guy, just not as confident. That’s actually worked out really well for us. </p><p><strong>Tone Madison: Anything special planned for this roast?</strong></p><p><strong>Mike Schmidt:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/artpaul" target="_blank">Art Paul Schlosser</a> might come out and sing a song making fun of all these comedians. If he doesn’t have the inspiration, I will tell them what they say about him out of earshot. </p><p><strong>Tone Madison: He’s an interesting presence at the comedy open-mics, because it’s fun but also seems to create some tension. I’ve even seen comics actually rip into him during their own sets at open mics.</strong></p><p><strong>Mike Schmidt:</strong> Art Paul is a really nice guy. He’s hilarious, and he is hilarious to make fun of. What he added to the open mic over the years is something you can’t really quantify. He’ll play a song to start it off, or to start off the second half, and it focuses people, and it gets them to where they’re really willing to hear anything. He unfolds all their arms. Whenever a comedy show, people think, “OK, we’ll see how funny this person is, they’re probably not gonna be all that funny.” But Art Paul’s so disarming and honest and goofy that by the time he’s done, the first person that’s onstage, the crowd is already hot.</p>

    <article>
      <p>
	For the past few years Madison musician 
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/cobyashpis" target="_blank">Coby Ashpis</a> has been cultivating an approach to instrumental hip hop that delights in stringing fragmentary, almost granular samples into cohesive phrases, and relies heavily on Ashpis' live dexterity with a sampler. Ashpis grew up playing clarinet, even joining a klezmer band in high school, and while attending the University of Chicago he played Javanese Gamelan music, played guitar in a rock band called Squat The Condos, and wrote a thesis about the role of live-ness in electronic music.
</p>
<p>
	After moving to Madison, he began to showcase his beatmaking skills in a video series called “Beats Around Madison," which featured Ashpis simply toting his laptop and a sampler/controller called a Maschine to various locations—including a 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58h8elBYYGk" target="_blank">frozen-over Monona Bay</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOvrVHwHg9" target="_blank">pier behind the Memorial Union</a>—and firing off intricate sample-based performances on the spot. In the meantime he's also produced a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWvh-Z-knwE" target="_blank">song for the grime artist Afrikan Boy</a> and hooked up with Madison's <a href="https://catchwreckcollective.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Catch Wreck</a> electronic/hip-hop collective. On January 24, Catch Wreck will release Ashpis' first proper EP, <em>Loafer</em>. The six tracks on <em>Loafer</em> show Ashpis pulling his live-sampling prowess and ear for quirky samples into catchy, conversational hip-hop instrumentals, where hooks and rhythms may repeat but are likely to mutate, slotting a different batch of samples into their structures on each pass through. But all in all it's still accessible, thanks to more straightforward elements like the pitched-up vocal samples of "Our Winter's Cold" and the synth hooks of "Chewing Ice."
</p>
<p>
	Ahead of the EP's release and a 
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/752873291432482/" target="_blank">February 7 show at The Sett in Union South</a>, Ashpis met up with us for a brief interview. We've also got a stream of one of the EP's standout tracks, “Frankly."

	<strong>Tone Madison: On the <em data-redactor-tag="em">Loafer</em> EP, was there any particular thing you were trying to accomplish in terms of the production style or the compositions?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Coby Ashpis: </strong>I think overall just something super dynamic with a lot of details, and overloading each bar with something a little bit different. A lot of the songs don't have any consistent loops. I kind of just built as I went, which I would hope is a bit different from a lot of people's approach of copy-paste-paste-paste. I like switching things up and putting in a lot of different surprises to make something super-dense that's rewarding on repeat listen, I guess.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: You've mentioned to me before that you work kind of slow. Is that approach part of the reason why?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Coby Ashpis:</strong> Yeah. I think I'm pretty new to production, so it takes me a little longer to get to the result that I have in mind.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: What was your point of entry into electronic music and hip-hop music?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Coby Ashpis:</strong> Probably the <em>Now</em> CDs back in the day. I'm pretty sure the first rap song I heard was off <em>Now 2</em>, like Jay-Z's “Hard Knock Life" or something. And then electronic stuff, I guess video games. It's pretty potent electronic stuff, pretty lean and interesting and melodic, and it just gets stuck in your head.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: How did you decide to focus your production work so much on live Maschine stuff? You emphasize that a lot, especially in the Beats Around Madison videos.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Coby Ashpis: </strong>My roommate when I was in college had a 404 hardware sampler—I don't know if you know the Roland SP-404. Ian Carroll [<a href="http://www.tonemadison.com/articles/the-great-sprawling-crashprez-and-hitmayng-interview-of-2015/" target="_blank">*hitmayng</a>] uses that one a lot in his live sets. But my roommate had that and I borrowed it once and started using it for drumming and got really into it and then saw that there was a whole community of people who do that kind of stuff. I really liked it because I guess to me what I felt like was being lost in a lot of electronic music was that kind of virtuosity and that kind of fear that the performer would mess up and make a mistake—everything was so clean and so perfect. So I liked that you could get sloppy and really expressive, and how it was completely flexible. I just got obsessed. But yeah, live-ness is super important to me. I think it's a vestigial kind of structure to have a stage and have an audience facing forward and nobody's really doing anything worth seeing—sometimes there's a light show or visuals—but I like putting back some sort of expressive virtuosity. I mean, I sacrifice other things, and I mess up a lot, and it's difficult for me to do everything smoothly, but I think it's worthwhile. When people get it, I think they appreciate it.

<p>
	<br>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Tone Madison: When you were making the new EP, were there any particular sounds that you were really drawn to that you worked on incorporating? One song is called “Wine Glasses," which betrays kind of a fascination with the kinds of sounds you're sourcing.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Coby Ashpis: </strong>Yeah, the main sound on that is just one hit of a wine glass and it gets played like an instrument. I would kind of mine a lot of rough amateur recordings that I found online. I really liked crunches and texture. There's tires rolling on gravel and an apple crunch—on “Wine Glasses" at the very end, there's a big hearty apple crunch. Everything but the kitchen sink. I just think it's fun to work with very eccentric pairings of things. There's Enya samples and Ginuwine samples next to a Beethoven string sample. I don't think I have anything in mind, I just dig on the Internet and try to think of a keyword that would be really interesting, like “crunchy footsteps," whatever pops into my head.

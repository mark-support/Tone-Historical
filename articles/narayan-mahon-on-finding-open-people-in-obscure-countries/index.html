	The exhibit <em>Lands In Limbo</em>, running <a href="http://www.mmoca.org/exhibitions-collection/exhibits/narayan-mahon-lands-limbo" target="_blank">through March 15 at the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art</a>, captures Madison-based photographer <a href="http://www.narayanmahon.com/" target="_blank">Narayan Mahon</a>'s visits over several years to countries whose very existence is precarious. Nagorno Karabakh, Northern Cyprus, Abkhazia, Transnistria, and Somaliland all exist as nations in spite of any real recognition from the international community—each one's origin has a lot of its own nuances, of course, but each one exists almost solely because it says that its exists. Mahon doesn't talk about these trips—which he mostly took between 2008 and 2010, during breaks from grad school at Syracuse—as particularly dangerous, and as for the geopolitical content of the show, he simply sums that up as “This place exists, here's a little glimpse of it… it's not the be-all end-all of unrecognized countries. It's an introduction." Mostly he talks about the work as driven by simple curiosity and the desire to hunt down great pictures, often with the help of translators, journalists, and, more often than note, friendly locals who welcomed his efforts. Yes, he captures plenty evidence of political instability and conflict, in heartbreaking photos like one of a desecrated Muslim cemetery in Nagorno Karabakh, but Mahon is just as drawn to the everyday—the strangely beautiful glow of a little store on a bleak snowy night, the confident smirk of a man waiting in line to vote, a row of pigs' heads on the sidewalk outside a butcher shop. Mahon recently met up with me to talk about the show.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: What attracted you to this idea of unrecognized states?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Narayan Mahon:</strong> Just a real basic and simple curiosity of something I didn't know anything about beforehand: “I wonder what it's like in this place," or “I've never seen one, I've never heard of such a thing." I think that's something very common for photographers: “Why did you shoot this?" “I don't know. I wondered what it would look like!" I remember one quote from a photographer from the '30s or '40s where someone asked, “Why did you take that picture?" And he said, “Because I wanted to see what it would look like as a picture." I think that's pretty much what drives most photographers.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: What was the first country you really got serious about visiting?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Narayan Mahon:</strong> Nagorno Karabakh was the first one I went to. I started this in graduate school, and so when the first winter break came around I went to Nagorno Karabakh.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Which brings us around to one of the most striking photos in the show, “Church, Shushi, Nagorno Karabakh 2006." Just the character of the light is really different from anything else in the show—there's almost this oil-painting texture to it.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Narayan Mahon: </strong>Yeah, it's something that I think a lot of people are drawn to for that reason. They see that kind of 16th-century Dutch work in it. I'm not that sophisticated, personally, to have been referencing that when I shot it. I just see something and I'm drawn to it. I can recognize nice light. It's not like something where, “I'm gonna reference this Dutch master!" But people are drawn to this, and that's why I like this picture too. Mostly I remember it being very cold. I spent three weeks in Nagorno Karabakh in the winter, between mid-December and a little bit into January, into their Christmas—they're Orthodox, so they have Christmas around January 6.

<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Are there a lot of difficulties in just arranging travel to an unrecognized country? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Narayan Mahon: </strong>Yeah. Even to go to a country that borders it, from which you can travel over land—to go to Nagorno Karabakh, you go through Armenia. So it's not like there's a direct flight from New York. Nothing's direct to any of these places, because they all broke away from not very big, well-known countries as it is. You say, “I'm going to Nagorno Karabakh." They say, “Where's that?" You say, “Oh, it broke away from Azerbaijan," and they say, “Where's that?" And you say, “It's in the Caucasus," and they say “Where's that?" All of these are pretty obscure countries to begin with, but not minor in any way—Nagorno Karabakh's like the size of Delaware. It's not a tiny place with 10 people.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: With each country in the show, you have images that point to destruction and violence, but more often you depict very everyday things, like people getting haircuts or going to church or playing at the beach. Was it important to you to strike that balance?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Narayan Mahon: </strong>I mean, ultimately, I was trying to always get a little bit more of an intimate view into personal life, and I think that's one failure of the project is that I don't really get that. I wasn't able to achieve that all the time.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Is that just because it can take a lot of time to build up the relationships and trust you need to get really intimate photos?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Narayan Mahon: </strong>That and not every time did I have a translator or a fixer, because of my budget. Because I'm spending it all to get there and have a place to sleep and get around. To be able to hire somebody is tricky, too. That's the most expensive part. I do a lot of wandering around and observing and standing in a church for a few hours, when there's nobody in there except for the choir, and a couple people trickle in and out to say prayers.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: What were the biggest challenges in getting access to a certain place, or getting people to let their guard down?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Narayan Mahon:</strong> I think mostly I encountered pretty open people. They're kind of feeling very obscure in the world, and a little bit of outside attention goes a long way. Not that what I'm doing is gonna help them in any way. It doesn't. But just that somebody might know about their existence is kind of nice for them, right? It's like, OK, somebody is gonna go back and there will be an article about it or something like that, and people will learn about their struggle and existence. I only encountered people that were open to it. Sometimes with officials or police or military, there's more skepticism. I would run into that, but mostly just like military kind of things. I wanted to go photograph a hospital in Abkhazia, and I went to the minister of health, and I speak pretty poor Russian, and I was in his office and we talked for like 45 minutes and I don't know what the hell he was saying, mostly. But then he picked up the phone and called the hospital and was like, “Yeah, OK, I think you can go." Sometimes things just take a little time, but like I said, in the end, I'm not there to cause any harm and I'm not looking for state secrets or anything.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: One of the really striking ones from Northern Cyprus, "Dividing Wall #2, Lefkosa, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," has this out-of-focus figure in the foreground and the guard in the background, and it's hard not to read into this scene. What was going on in that moment?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Narayan Mahon: </strong>Honestly, I was waiting for somebody to come by into the foreground. I waited for two hours or something. It was late at night. I wanted something around the wall. In Cyprus I pretty much just walked back and forth along this wall for two weeks. Everything's along the wall, because that's a special theme for Northern Cyprus, and for Cyprus, is that the capital is the only walled-off, divided capitol in the world like this. So just kind of waiting for the kind of pictures that say something about it. It's not like this shadowy lady's really about to bolt across the wall or anything, but there is some tension there. She's crouched down, kind of in the shadows, and the authority of this kind of weird little box [guard post].

<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: I really didn't want to read too much into it, but just the light and the focus create a lot of tension.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Narayan Mahon: </strong>Yeah. Just waiting for those pieces to kind of come together so that I can express that tension, whether that tension is real or—I mean, there is tension there. It's a walled city. You can't have a walled city without tension. I'm not playing by strict journalistic rules where everything has to be exactly what it is and I can't read anything more into that or use this to speak to anything other than what it is. I can. That's kind of what this picture does. I was just kind of waiting, hoping for the right things to come around and fall into place.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Of the places you visited, which was the most challenging or difficult, either in terms of travel or just getting the photos you wanted? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Narayan Mahon:</strong> I don't know if one was more challenging than the other. Logistically, Somaliland is challenging. Abkhazia is really challenging logistically too. The times I went to Abkhazia, I went through Georgia, across the border, sometimes it's a challenge getting across the border. There's no challenge getting across the border in Somaliland, but the times I went to Somaliland I would go to Ethiopia and take a bus from  Addis Ababa, the capitol, and that's 30 hours in a bus, or 18 hours in a bus, across Ethiopia. It's not easy going, but to be there a little bit longer or hire a translator for a few days, that's the difference. In Somaliland, to leave the capitol you need to have a soldier from the army go with you, and it only costs 10 bucks a day, but it's 10 bucks a day! That's what my hotel cost!
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: You seem pretty cool and unfazed by all this. You don't seem to have much self-importance or a vibe of “I'm battle-hardened, I've seen things!" Does that help you as a photographer?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Narayan Mahon:</strong> Yeah, I like to think I'm an easygoing person, and I like to think I'm not too self-important. One of my biggest pet peeves in this kind of photography are those personalities that are, like, they're saving the world. I don't think I am. I don't think anybody really is, for the most part, because, the world's in pretty bad shape, so if someone thinks they're saving the world, they're doing a pretty poor job of it. I think it helps just in terms of being patient. I wait a long time for the right picture to come along. There would be days where I would be kind of wound-up: “I'm not getting what I want, I'm counting every dollar I've got, I'm in this hotel, or I'm sick and not out making pictures." But then it's like, well, if you're making pictures and they're not the right kind of pictures, you're still just wasting your money there. That was usually my biggest stress, just worrying if I was making the pictures that I wanted to be making or that I thought I should be making. Only a few times was I worried about safety kinds of things. If someone was like, “No, I don't want you to come here," I mean, I was bummed. I don't take no very well—“I'm just taking a picture!" “No, you can't take a picture of this!" That always pisses me off.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: It's really funny how protective people can be about that. </strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Narayan Mahon: </strong>Yeah. “It's just your car! It'll be alright!" But yeah, I think being easygoing, I think it's good just from a self-preservation standpoint. Otherwise you're just a ball of nerves, right? That's no fun. I'd rather just be a little more relaxed.

	<strong>Tone Madison: One of my favorites photos in the show is "Black Sea, Sukhumi, Abkhazia, 2008," of this man on the shore of the Black Sea at dusk. What's this man's story?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Narayan Mahon: </strong>It's in the capitol of Abkhazia, Sukhumi. I'd see this guy around quite often. He just wanders around ranting. He's kind of a crazy guy. He goes around yelling all the time and he'll be in the middle of the street with cars around him, and people just kind of shake their heads. He's yelling all this stuff about Georgia. At the time, the president of Georgia was Mikheil Saakashvili, so he would yell obscenities about Saakashvili. He was a bit of a madman, but also had so much anger towards Georgia, the country that they broke away from and are in this conflict with. I saw him later one day on the shore, and just the way he was moving, it just felt—one, I'm a sucker for kind of a vanishing horizon line between sky and sea, and really trying to blend those together. I was already in the spot I wanted to be, and then I just kind of followed him until he was doing the right thing, and he has this kind of gesture that's almost soaring.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: It's funny, because it looks like a very peaceful moment, and you could almost imagine that he's praying or meditating or doing tai chi. Is he really off on a tear in this moment?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Narayan Mahon: </strong>Yeah, he's just totally like, I don't know what he's saying, and my Russian's not that good. Actually, he was ranting in Abkhaz and I asked somebody what he was saying and they said, “Oh, he's just talking shit about Georgia."
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: You had a few years between when you finished shooting this series and when you put the MMOCA show together. Did that give you a chance to see everything with fresh eyes and maybe notice some things about the works that you hadn't noticed before? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Narayan Mahon: </strong>I think it's good to put your work away for a while, after you've been spending so much time with it, and then come back. It's not going anywhere. Your style might have changed a little bit, or what you think is an important picture might not be anymore, and so it's gone through that a few times, and then working with the curators here was really helpful, too, to kind of get their thoughts on it, because they're pretty used to looking at a much broader range of work. It's a lot of stuff to go through. And, every picture here was select from the minute I looked at it. I don't think I have anything sitting on a hard drive that would knock any one of these off the wall and replace it.

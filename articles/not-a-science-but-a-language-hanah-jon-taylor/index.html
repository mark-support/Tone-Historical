      <p>
	Hanah Jon Taylor, who 
	<a href="http://www.motherfools.com/calendar.php?uri=calendar" target="_blank">performs this Friday at Mother Fool's with pianist Dave Adler</a>, has been at work on a new piece called "Real/Surreal." It's in five movements, it harnesses Taylor's knack for emotionally expansive improvisation on sax, flute, and wind-synth—and beyond that, it's subject to a great deal of change. In March he <a href="http://artsextract.com/2014/04/25/hanah-jon-taylors-realsurreal-wpt-performance/" target="_blank">performed a short version of the piece on Wisconsin Public Television's '30 Minute Music Hour,' </a>which featured drummer Dushun Mosley incorporating hand percussion and bassist Alex Wing switching between bass and oud. And it's since evolved because others, including Adler, have been brought into the piece, but also because Taylor, a stalwart improviser, sees a piece of music as something that's never quite set in stone, but always morphing to reflect the moment. Taylor has lived in Madison since 1993 and teaches at Madison Media Institute, but does most of his performing elsewhere, with his own Hanah Jon Taylor Artet, the Franco-American group <a href="http://www.denisfournier.fr/watershed_en.htm" target="_blank">Watershed</a>, and numerous collaborators (this year has included a trip to Paris, where he said he planned to meet up with Archie Shepp). Taylor hopes to have a complete version of the piece by the end of the summer, and plans to record an album version of it.
</p>
<p>
	Taylor also has a sometimes edgy relationship with Madison itself. He's been part of numerous efforts to give improvised and otherwise adventurous music a stronger place in town, including co-founding the Madison Center for Creative and Cultural Arts, which 
	<a href="http://www.thedailypage.com/daily/article.php?article=8340" target="_blank">closed in 2007</a>. But in trying to contribute he's encountered a lot of frustration, including a lack of decently paying shows and a lack of venues that aren't bars. Generally he feels that what a musician gets in town isn't up to his standards, and he has a point, as he has a long history in jazz and improvised music, and his scope isn't limited to Madison. If you get him going about it, he gets kind of pissed-off, but the occasional irascibility is part of the man's charm. Taylor recently talked with me about developing "Real/Surreal" and why the limitations he finds in Madison aren't always a bad thing.

<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: Back in March you performed a version of a new piece, "Real/Surreal," for Wisconsin Public Television. How has the piece been coming along since then?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Hanah Jon Taylor:</strong> It's kind of hard to talk about music that's untitled, but it's in five movements. It's all improvisation, but I think people get a real distorted or incorrect view about improvisation as a musical form. There's a lot to be thought about. It's not like rocket science, it's like brain surgery. Collective brain surgery. At the same time it's probably one of the most democratic acts that an artist can have in collaboration with other artists. One of the things that's important in improvisation is a solid beginning, an idea. We could have a conversation about that idea brings about whatever happens in the movements.
</p>
<p>
	When I tell people these compositions are untitled, they think, "Oh, he's just playing anything he wants to play." In fact, I've been thinking about this shit for two years. Actually longer than that. I've got a buddy in Seattle that's ready to write the liner notes. It's not folly. And it's not jamming. But the problem with the way we deal with music in the West is the same problems with the way we teach it. We teach it like a science, but it's a language. I've had the opportunity to be in places where it's never thought of as a science, and it flows just like language. Some of us actually think that music itself is black dots on white paper, and that's the furthest thing from the truth, so why start there?
</p>
<p>
	The day after that television thing we went into the studio and added David Adler on piano and made him part of the conversation. Now it's just a thing of listening.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: What are some of the ideas behind that title, "Real/Surreal"?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Hanah Jon Taylor: </strong>I think of life as a dance between the real and the surreal. What is real can easily become surreal in how things work. I mean, there's surrealism and surreality in three-dimensional life. Some of it can be funny and some of it can be macabre, but for something to go from real to surreal, that's usually an experience we don't forget. And we can also go in reverse, as in dreams. I think an example of the surreal becoming real has to do with this idea of creative visualization, where first you think it, then you visualize it, and if you can visualize it every day and add to it every day, and put it in a framework that constitutes itself and eliminates anything outside of itself, then that becomes real. Usually when that happens we ask ourselves, especially when we weren't very diligent in our vision, how in the fuck did I get myself in this situation? And it's usually because we forgot to include something in the vision. I just don't think that we talk or ideate enough as artists on the now of all of that. This whole thing about jazz being a museum piece is something that I try to work against in word and deed.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: Were there any particular music ideas that you were drawn to as you started making the piece?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Hanah Jon Taylor: </strong>My approach to it has been kind of neoclassical in that it's in five movements. It has an opus. In the studio, the opus lasts 20 minutes. We couldn't do that on television. Which is kind of a real constraint to me. I mean, I've been knowing ['30MMH' host Andy Moore] and his wife for over 20 years, good friends, and I was kind of flattered that he would ask me to do the thing. But it was hard to take him seriously when he said, "You've got 26 minutes and 45 seconds." Are you kidding me? As I said, we worked three hours in the studio the next day, and that was the first movement. So it's kind of hard to say that what we did was really representative.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: So you had to pull off a condensed version, then.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Hanah Jon Taylor: </strong>Cliffs Notes, man. You know about Cliffs Notes? 'War And Peace,' Cliffs Notes.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: But was there anything about that experience that turned out to be beneficial?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Hanah Jon Taylor:</strong> As a matter of fact, on that occasion, we had a chance to try something that we had talked about….we incorporated hand drums with the drum set, if you noticed, and juxtaposed the oud, which is a very primitive instrument, with the wind synthesizer.

<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: What else have you been working on, musically?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Hanah Jon Taylor: </strong>In this next chapter, I need to be mobile and self-reliant in terms of the group, in terms of how the group moves, who's in the group. Maybe self-reliant is not the word. Solid. In order to have that solidity, first and foremost I've got to be solid. I've got to be solid about my approach to the music, as flimsy as the compositions may be. I still have to be very solid about what it is I want to put out.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: Why do you say they're flimsy?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Hanah Jon Taylor: </strong>Because I want them to be flimsy. I want them to change. I don't want a composition that I came up with in 1994 to be the same in 2014. That's what recordings are for. And recordings, I look at as advertising for the real thing. It's a documentation of what happened at that time—that don't mean it's stuff you're supposed to keep doing. You get people playing Rachmaninoff, and when they practice it it's just like it's written, and that's beautiful, and I have nothing but admiration for people who can do that. But it kind of negates the improvisational nature of Rachmaninoff! I mean, how did this shit sound last weekend, Rachmaninoff? Nobody asked him that! In our Western tradition, it's easy for us to notate the sound frequency, but we can't notate the emotion. That was the cool thing about a lot of bebop musicians and post-bop musicians. What they did is kind of like, I think has a lot more integrity than sampling, because it gave tribute and recognition to the integrity of original compositions, still giving their take on it. Like John Coltrane's "My Favorite Things"—that song will never be the same for anyone who's ever heard it. Because of Coltrane I appreciate the words more, because if you're going to take a piece like that in order to—when I listened to it, there was a time in my youth when I listened to that every day…. You file it in your reference of emotions, well, not only do you not have to read the fucking notes, you can tell the story any way you want to tell it. Again, going from what might be considered the real, to the surreal.

	<strong>
	Tone Madison: Last time I tried to interview you a couple years ago, you were—
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Hanah Jon Taylor:</strong> Eating something?
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: No, you were pissed off about something that someone else had written, in Isthmus.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Hanah Jon Taylor: </strong>We can laugh about it now.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: I think you had taken issue with <a href="http://www.isthmus.com/daily/article.php?article=38380" target="_blank">their use of the word "snazzy"?</a>
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Hanah Jon Taylor:</strong> "You're gonna hear some snazzy jazz!" I'm still mad about that. No, I'm not still mad about it. Just on that note, I think that media has a lot to do with the cultivation and success of any artistic genre, especially in an area of the world where it may be considered common. Sometimes you don't recognize the forest for the trees, and as a music-history teacher I'm always amazed by how little my students know about the geniuses that surround them, in their midst, like Clyde Stubblefield. And I guess that's the way it is. I still have to get on an airplane, it seems like, and go somewhere, to get a really good-paying concert gig, to play in front of a really big crowd. Other than the Chicago Jazz Festival, but I've done that so many times that now the thing is playing the after-sets. I was in Poland last year, playing to a couple of thousand people, with Watershed!

<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: You've talked a lot about the frustrations and limitations of living in Madison and working as a musician. So what is it that keeps you here?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Hanah Jon Taylor:</strong> Well, a couple things that keep me here—I have a child here. That's the main reason that I'm still here. But there's another reason that has become kind of nice. You see, one of the cool things about living in Madison, Wisconsin as a jazz artist, quote unquote, is that there's no place to play. Now that might sound kind of strange, but if you are really into doing this, and there's no place to play, that means that you are forced to do two things—work on your craft while you're here, with fewer distractions than you would have in Chicago, plus when I go to Chicago. If I were living in Chicago, it would be like, "Oh Hanah's playing down the street, he plays there once a month, we can see him some other time." And it motivates me to be on my best game because I know people are coming to LISTEN, rather than drink or impress their girlfriends. Which is the motivation for most young college crowds. I like to drink and impress women just like everybody else, but when I go to listen to music, I don't want that to have to be the environment, so I try to keep the music out of those places. Plus there's not one place in Madison, Wisconsin where there's an acoustic piano in a venue, did you know that? Name one. The Fountain has one, I hear, but paying $150 a band, you'll never see me. So, again, it's kind of ironic that that place emerged after everybody left—after Roscoe Mitchell left, after Vincent Davis left, all of the sudden we have this downtown jazz club. I had a place around the corner from the Overture Center [the Madison Center for Creative and Cultural Arts, which closed in 2007], that opened two months before the Overture Center, with a 9-foot grand piano, but we didn't have a liquor license.

	Tone Madison: It is a problem here, how music is so bound up in alcohol sales.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Hanah Jon Taylor:</strong> But I'm answering and at the same time justifying your question as to why I'm still here. Because it's a good place to practice and a good place to raise a kid. It's not a good place to work as an artist, but do I really want to do that where I live? Well, maybe not. I mean, sometimes Madison, Wisconsin can be like paradise, and sometimes it can feel like Mississippi. And when it feels like that, I get in my car and go to Chicago. I can go to Istanbul, stay gone for three months, and come back here—nothing's changed. There's some advantages to that. If you look at it as being advantageous rather than disadvantageous, it works for you. That's anywhere. I know cats probably in jail, saying "At least I've got a corner cell. At least I ain't gotta live next door to what's-his-name."

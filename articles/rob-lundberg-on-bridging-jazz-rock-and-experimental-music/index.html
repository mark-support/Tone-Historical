	Bassist Rob Lundberg is still very new in Madison—he moved here from New York City in 2013, and has spent a good chunk of the intervening time traveling back there and to New Mexico—but he's building up a diverse musical presence for himself here. While still keeping up his NYC collaborations, including the fractious experimental outfit 
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/jobsband" target="_blank">Jobs</a> (formerly named <a href="https://killerbob.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Killer Bob</a>) and heady synth-pop act <a href="https://leveragemodels.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Leverage Models</a>, Lundberg has occasionally performed his <a href="http://roblundberg.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">solo-bass material</a> in town, improvised with Madison-based musicians including saxophonist Tony Barba and guitar/experimenter Andy Fitzpatrick, and worked as a coordinator for the <a href="http://www.tonemadison.com/articles/how-much-can-the-greater-madison-jazz-consortium-get-done-in-2015/" target="_blank">Greater Madison Jazz Consortium</a>. In the latter role, Lundberg and another bass player, Nick Moran, organized <a href="http://www.tonemadison.com/articles/the-strollin-jazz-series-promising-model/" target="_blank">last year's musically diverse Strollin' series</a>, and is also helping with future GMJC events, including a series planned for next month at the Central Library.
</p>
<p>
	Lundberg will join his Jobs bandmates Max Jaffe (drums) and Dave Scanlon (guitar) 
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/650840211729085/" target="_blank">this Sunday for a show at Bright Red Studios</a>, as Jobs prepares for the June release of a new album, <em>Killer Bob Sings</em>. It's the group's first album to feature vocals. The change brings an eerie yet accessible focus to the band's abrasive approach on songs like “Fed Well," but sometimes becomes part of the gibbering, rhythmically precise texture, as on “Rhythm Changes." (The band isn't posting tracks from the new album for the public just yet, but will be performing new material on Sunday.) In addition to gearing up for the Jobs release and more GMJC events, Lundberg is working on combining his budding interest in photography and video with his solo music. Ahead of Sunday's show, Lundberg met up with me to talk about finding his place in Madison, combining experimentation with accessibility, and his Green Bay Packers guitar strap.

	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: How have you found Madison so far, as far as collaborations and shows?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Rob Lundberg:</strong> I feel like I've been slowly finding my way. My friend Patrick Breiner [who used to live in Madison] kind of primed me and gave me the general lowdown before I came out here, just folks he still knew and things he was able to do while he was here. He's definitely more in the jazz realm than I am. I've moved away from it a lot more than he has. We both went to jazz school at The New School at different times. He came here a couple months after I moved here and we did a tour together around the Midwest, which was really great.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: You're still actively playing in Jobs and Leverage Models, which are both back in NYC. How have you been juggling that?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Rob Lundberg: </strong>Jobs is a very collaborative effort between the three of us, so that's what I've stayed most active with out there, I'd say. I usually go out there every two three months and play some shows or do some recording or writing new stuff. We were actually just out in L.A. together in February, because our drummer was living out there for the winter, so we played some shows and started writing some new material. Everything in Jobs is very collaborative. Leverage Models is much more Shannon Fields' project. I've still done some touring with it and I still do recording stuff, but a lot of that is him sending me tracks and saying, “Try something out on this," or “Can you double this thing I wrote?" He's a really good friend still, and he actually produced the Jobs record that's coming out this summer, so there's a lot of different cross-incestuous collaboration with him and everyone. Dave Scanlon, the guitarist from Jobs, and who also plays in Leverage Models, he just put out a solo record that I played bass and drums on and we started recording it this past summer when I was out in New York. I feel like most music circles are like that—there's maybe 10 or 15 people, and everyone has their own projects with different people calling the shots. Which is fun. It's cool to get to work with people you're really comfortable with and work with them in different ways. You have that comfort, and kind of freedom to be more open with your thoughts and ideas, but to get to experience it or work with a new person taking the helm can be really fun.

	<br>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Tone Madison: When Leverage Models played at the High Noon a year ago, I remember furtively trying to take Instagram photos of you, because you had this setup with a headless bass and a Packers strap. That's not even a gear-nerd observation, it's just interesting.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Rob Lundberg: </strong>I got the bass on tour in Chicago three or four years ago, and on that same tour, we were playing with some friends of ours from New York, but playing with the in Cleveland, and they had just been in Youngstown where a couple of them grew up, and they went to this music store that they used to go to all the time when they were kids that was closing down and having a massive sale, and they found this Packers strap. And they're like, “We have to get this for Rob!" So I show up at the show and they present this to me, and it just all came together. Those two have been inseparable since then. And that's actually the electric bass I play 90 percent of the time, with both of those bands.

<p>
	<br>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Tone Madison: And then your solo-bass stuff is of course pretty different from those bands. Is it more improvisation-driven or more compositionally driven?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Rob Lundberg: </strong>It's very compositionally focused in a certain regard. I theoretically have a lot of time to work on it, but in my creative process I'm a very deadline-driven person, so usually it's when I book some shows or someone else asks me to do some shows or record something that I finally take my ideas that have been percolating in my mind or that I've been playing around with on the instrument—I need that deadline to force me to solidify something. Otherwise it'll just kind of keep gestating forever. Being very involved with different bands and touring a lot, I was doing a lot of managerial responsibilities, booking tours and general logistics, and feeling like I was getting a little sucked in and overtaken personally, and losing my own creative impulse. Or just feeling like I needed to push myself to do something totally on my own. That's why I started doing the solo stuff, and with it I was really interested in figuring out, how can I take this instrument that you really never see on its own and rarely see as the front piece or focal point of a performance, how do you expand the sounds it can make and what people expect from it, and create pieces that are really compositionally captivating using very simple ideas? Usually, each piece is one simple technical or compositional idea, and then using different ways to develop that so that it still has some sort of arc to it. But yeah, the pieces end up being very minimalist. There's one piece in particular, “Philip," that when I wrote it out, I was thinking, what would a solo bass piece written by Phillip Glass sound like? I'd just seen <em>Einstein On The Beach</em>, and just this idea of using very simple major triads, shifting the position of them, and using a very simple technique of hammer-ons and pull-offs. A lot of his stuff, especially <em>Einstein On The Beach</em>, has this relentless pulse to it that's almost to the point of strangling the music. It's so rigid. But using that as this really deliberate driving force that pushes the piece forward and I think ends up keeping it pretty engaging, even though it is so simple and very slowly and pretty predictably evolving for the most part. And then just throwing in little curveballs to make it exciting and make sure you're not gonna lose people.

<p>
	<br>
	Even though the projects I'm in sound very different, I think I'm always really interested in blending that line between abstraction and sort of a pop sensibility, or a sensibility of finding the hook, whether that's in an abstract solo performance or in a song with lyrics—how can I skirt that line and use the catchy aspects to pull people into a world that's maybe stranger than they would normally venture into?
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: It definitely brings up that idea of constraints being a good driver of creativity.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Rob Lundberg: </strong>I'm a very strong believer in that. And definitely with the solo stuff, I was very deliberately reacting against the tendency for people to use loop pedals and stuff like that in solo performances, and trying to figure out how can I make the bass almost sound like multiple instruments. I've started using some pre-recorded tracks mixed with live tracks and built this two-pronged amplification system that it all runs through, but still I prefer that to the looping strategy. I feel like it's a very easy crutch to lean on, and I've maybe only seen two people pull it off where it's engaging the whole time, and it's not like there is 30 seconds or a minute at the beginning of the song where it's almost not the song and they're just setting it up, and then the song starts once they have enough loops built up. I get really peeved by that, because I feel like it's sort of inconsiderate to the audience.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: I've seen people do really great, engaging sets with loop pedals, but I've seen people do pretty trite stuff with them too.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Rob Lundberg:</strong> Merrill Garbus from Tune-Yards, I feel like she's the most amazing performer who uses a loop pedal. I saw her when it was still just her and Nate Brenner playing bass, and I feel like it never had a moment where it was just her setting up a loop for the sake of setting it up.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: William Tyler uses loop pedals really well, but also he has a foundation of just being a good guitar player.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Rob Lundberg:</strong> And I feel like his approach with it is pretty different, because things end up being so much more amorphous and soundscape-y. it doesn't give that impression of just stacking things on top of each other. We did a Leverage Models show with him in Nashville a few years ago. One of the more bizarre bills, but he and Shannon are friends from somewhere.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: And then on another front, you're working on organizing shows and programs with the Greater Madison Jazz Consortium. What have you found interesting about that?

	Rob Lundberg:</strong> I think with a lot of the programming we're trying to do, we're trying to put jazz in a new context literally and figuratively, just to make it more accessible to people, so that people can just try it out if it's something they're not normally into, or if they have a certain perception of what it is and that it's something they don't like. They can try it out and realize that it's very wide-ranging. In the programming, we're very conscientious of making sure we're covering a whole range, from very traditional straight-ahead jazz to world-music traditions and much more abstract improvisation. All over the map. [At the Strollin' events] I was really amazed at how much audience members were really into a wide range of stuff, more so than I expected. That was really satisfying for me to see, and makes me want to keep doing that sort of programming. It does feel like there can be all these little sub- sub- sub-genres that people can get stuck in.

	Tone Madison: Is it also good to get not just a variety of music, but also to deal with a whole range of ages and backgrounds in the music community?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Rob Lundberg: </strong>In New York, because it's so big, you just often end up in your circle doing whatever music you're focused on, because it takes so much more energy going physically from place to place and making sure you're going to those shows and socializing in that world. It's hard to be so varied. So it's been really nice here in Madison that every few months I can sub for an orchestra gig and play some Copland and some Tchaikovsky, and then play a gig doing jazz standards and then play a weird free improv thing, and then go on tour with Leverage Models and play dance-pop music. I really love that variety. Bringing different sensibilities across genres is really fun for me.

	Tone Madison: Getting back to Jobs, what did you try to accomplish on the new album?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Rob Lundberg: </strong>The biggest difference is working with a singer, which we'd never done before. We worked with a good friend of ours who we went to college with. We were really interested in becoming more inclusive in the weird music we were making. We felt like for ourselves and a lot of other groups that operate in this world of experimental music, that there's often a lot of intentional other-ness and kind of holding the audience at a distance. And also just to create a certain perception or feeling, which we felt like we did unintentionally. I mean, we as people, I think we always are surprised when people get a certain perception of us from our music that we're very serious and impenetrable people, individually, when we're just kind of very lighthearted generally.
</p>
<p>
	We were trying to figure out how to keep all the elements of musical experimentation and other-ness and weirdness that we're interested in, but making that a little more inclusive, and changing our idea of the audience reaction being, “Oh man, that band was fucked up" to “Oh, we're all fucked up. And that's OK, and we're fucked up together." And obviously, working with a human voice immediately makes things more accessible to people. It seemed natural to ask [Daniel Ellis-Ferris, who sings on the album] to start working with us and try to write some music with him, and explore a bit more of the rock-band and pop-song world, because we have that instrumentation going on but we definitely started out coming from a more jazz and even contemporary-classical world.
</p>

	Tone Madison: What's the live setup going to be at the show on Sunday?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Rob Lundberg:</strong> The live setup is still just the trio of Max, Dave, and I, but all three of us have started singing now since working with Daniel, taking on some of his vocal parts and re-writing things and starting to write new material with vocals. We're sharing the singing evenly, which is nice because none of us are trained or really great singers, and I think it also just creates a really nice, more inclusive feeling, of rather than this singular front person, it's more of a collective effort, and a little more humble because we're all doing our best at vocalizing. We occasionally feature Daniel as some sampled tracks in our Roland 404, just because there are a few pieces that he just delivers like we never could, and I think on certain songs it's just really crucial. It's kind of fun to play with a flip of where you might see a singer or MC with just backing tracks, to see a live band with singer tracks. It's not something you often see.

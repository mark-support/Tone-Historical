	Madison musician Benjamin Bill's project 
	<a href="http://williamzvillain.com/" target="_blank">William Z. Villain</a> (kicking off a tour with his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/774302775932826" target="_blank">show this Wednesday at Bright Red Studios</a>) seems determined to keep the listener off balance with its nimble blend of gypsy-jazz and post-punk aggression. The project's songs, as heard on last year's <a href="http://williamzvillain.bandcamp.com/album/william-z-villain-ep" target="_blank">self-titled EP</a>, embody both playful whimsy and a distinctly brash and sinister edge, especially in Ben's high, at times needling voice. WZV has a way of picking up unlikely elements as it develops. A few years ago at a bus stop, Ben struck up a conversation with Ramon Gooden—who has co-written songs with 2Pac and toured with Digital Underground—and recruited him as WZV's drummer. And the project's output has also frequently veered off into ambient music and distinctly bizarre covers (you might hear him try a Mr. Bungle song once in a while). The songs on the EP range from the speedy, vertiginous caper "Tippy-Tippy-Top (The Inspector's Song)" and the woozy "Anybody Gonna Move?"<br>

<p>
	This year, Ben plans to post new songs at least once a month on his website, beginning with a 
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TV25eG34Tw" target="_blank">Clem Snide cover</a> and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmkyIhyNp3I" target="_blank">new original</a>. He also recently joined the surf/math-rock trio <a href="http://myrmidons.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Myrmidons</a>, and co-hosts the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/secretsongwriterseries" target="_blank">Monday-night Secret Songwriter Series at the Fountain</a>. Ben delved into some musical detail and just maybe messed with us a bit in an interview ahead of Wednesday's show.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: At the Bright Red Studios show and on this tour, will you just be playing solo?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Benjamin Bill: </strong>Louka Patenaude and Ramon will be backing me up at Bright Red. That will be more of a parlor acoustic set with light amplification and some hand drums. Just because I said "light amplification" doesn't mean it won't be raucous, though. Louka has harnessed the ancient energies of Earth and space, Ramon has been recently entranced by the organic tones of the goat-skin djembe, and I have been eating my
fruits and vegetables for a couple of months now. Though they are both masters at their craft, they are not coming with me on this tour. I'd prefer to first inspect these new towns and venues by myself before bringing a group into the wild.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: Are there any new songs or new covers that you'll be including in your upcoming shows?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Benjamin Bill: </strong>Yes. About twelve new pieces are currently being conjured. Two or three of them will be played on Wednesday at Bright Red. The new songs experiment with style changes and time/key modulations I have not tried before.
</p>
<p>
	For covers, I've been playing a version of "Samba Da Minha Terra" by Joao Gilberto that was redone in the '70s by a band called Novos Baianos. I've also been playing a creepy and corny 1920s love song called "Deep Night" by Rudy Vallee and I am starting to rearrange a really old Byzantine hymn.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: You've spent a lot of time recently hosting and performing at the Fountain on Monday nights with Louka. It seems to give you and the other players a lot of space to experiment. How has that affected your songwriting and playing?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Benjamin Bill:</strong> I enjoy playing their grand piano and Hammond B3 organ. I'm not sure how this gig affects my songwriting but I imagine it is a catalyst for new material because it has me playing and preparing new pieces all the time. It certainly affects the amount of friends I have in Madison. I meet new musicians there almost every week. Ten to twenty performers play each night spanning from classical, rock, ambient, folk, punk, bluegrass, rap, '80s synth-funk, free jazz, fingerstyle blues, spoken word, instrumental. It is similar to an open mic, but the diversity and level of professionalism can be stunning. Louka Patenaude and Daiquiri Jones will be overseeing the hosting duties of that event while I'm gone. Mondays at 8pm, folks.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison How are you feeling about the recordings on the EP from last year? Are they still pretty representative of where the project is going?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Benjamin Bill:</strong> Those songs were recorded with a National single-cone resonator guitar, drumset, percussion, Wurlitzer electronic piano, electric
bass, and some electric guitar. They were also recorded very quickly in a very dark purple basement room with low ceilings. I don't think any of the tracking was done during daylight hours and I didn't bother having them mastered. I modified some CB trucker microphones to get the rough vocal sounds on a few tracks. The recordings are a good representation of what the project sounds like with a somewhat traditional band setup, but a live William Z. Villain performance can exist in many forms. There are parlor acoustic performances such as the March 5 show at Bright Red, electric performances with a drum set, solo acoustic performances, solo ambient experimental performances. Ramon and I have been slowly writing and arranging a gypsy-thrash set so we can play with metal and hardcore bands. I also plan on putting together a completely unplugged version of the songs that uses tuba and drums like djembes and doun-doun (a big freaking bass drum from Africa). This group would be able to play loud creepy
dance tunes in places that don't have power outlets like parks, rooftops, abandoned buildings, row-boats, etc.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: You've mentioned before that you've played a lot of jazz, and that obviously is a big part of WZV sound. How did you end up deciding to combine that with more abrasive influences?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Benjamin Bill:</strong> I find the word "jazz" to be extremely vague because everyone has a different definition for it depending on where they came from. Some people think jazz is the crap you hear in elevators while some people think jazz is what was happening in New Orleans from around 1914 until
the 1940s. Some people think is a weird little club that musicians formed just so they can wank on their instruments and feel artistic. For a lot of musicians and listeners, jazz is something vague like: Music that associates with improvisation, reaction to others improvising (when you're playing with others), and the ability to include any styles or sounds into the tunes. To me, this means music with no rules. It can also encourage musicians to have a mastery of their instrument to a point where wonderful and complex musical ideas can be imagined and executed instantly. When taken seriously, it can be absolutely mind-blowing and invigorating music but a lot of the time it just makes people think about murder when they're waiting for the dentist. Just like no-limits gambling, you can win big and lose big when playing music with no rules. It means you are attempting to consider all of the available musical tools, styles, and techniques when you write and/or perform music. Looking at music this way seems to be the most interesting and challenging approach, so I do that sometimes. My music is probably abrasive because I purchased extremely cheap underwear in bulk last year and I'm still currently paying for it.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: You play bass and keys in a new band called Myrmidons, which also has an eccentric mix of styles--surf-rock, math-rock, maybe a bit of Mr. Bungle. How did that come about? Are those songs written pretty collaboratively?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Benjamin Bill: </strong>Courtney and Frank (sis and bro) wrote the songs and then I joined on bass and organ. Once I showed up, we arranged my parts and tweaked the syncopation and dynamics a bit. I play Latin and Afro-beat rhythms on the bass every chance I get, even when it doesn't make sense to. I think Frank is taking the lead on writing tunes right now and then we'll likely do some arranging together. All three of us have pretty good songwriting and technical skills on our instruments, so I can already tell the songs are going become even more complex and cohesive. They are both very creative, honest, and interesting to work with. Some people have said the drummer Courtney is a witch, and while I don't think they have much evidence to warrant such a claim, I still try not to piss her off. Frank is talented, young, and much stronger than me so I don't piss him off either.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Tone Madison: What's next for WZV and your other projects after this tour?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
	Benjamin Bill:</strong> I mentioned all those other live performance setups in the question about the EP. I will be touring again in the late summer--likely with a rhythm section. I am playing some collaborative sets with a wonderful acoustic duo called Snouts. A new William Z. Villain video/song is going to be released on the last day of every month for the entire year of 2014. By the time this interview comes out, there will be two of them online (williamzvillain.com). I plan to release some of my tunes on cassette tape, vinyl, sheet music, and with a hand-crank music box that is fed a long strip of paper with a grid that correlates to the tines (things that vibrate and make tones). The sheet music would allow me to hear other musicians perform their versions of my arrangements, and the music box would allow people to play my tunes on a fucking music box! You can hole-punch a song onto a slip of paper and then play it without electricity. It is so great. My friend and esteemed colleague Karsten Osterby (aka Sleepy Lesbos) turned me on to that. In the long run, I'll very likely die and decompose just like everyone else.

    <article>
      <p>(Pictured: A typical young-professional desk, probably. Photo by&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/ugmonk" target="_blank">Jeff Sheldon/Unsplash</a>)</p><p>As someone who roughly fits the description of “young professional” (I’m 30, I work in a professional field, I possess many varieties of completely unearned social privilege, and I own a MacBook Air), I’m beginning to resent being told what I want and why I live in Madison.</p><p>In just about any conversation about new development in Madison or the future of the local economy, you’re going to hear about the young professionals. They’re driving it all and we must give them what they want, which is density, amenities, jobs in the tech sector, and then they can come here and disrupt stuff or whatever. Yes, said young professionals are part of the story and we do need to pay attention to what they want, but often “young professionals” has become shorthand for something that doesn’t really speak to everyone in their 20s and 30s who is trying to move up in the world, build a life, and make a meaningful contribution. There is a fine line here between understanding a certain demographic and lapsing into&nbsp;<a href="http://prospect.org/article/ruse-creative-class-0" target="_blank">Richard Florida bullshit</a>. </p><p>Now, it’s not that I am really against the “young professionals” and everything that phrase represents. I think there is a lot of good coming out of that group of people, and in next year’s mayoral election I will likely vote for District 8 Alder Scott Resnick, who’s definitely the most young professional-ish candidate. It’s just that we’ve got to step back and see them as part of a bigger picture. To put too much emphasis on enticing the “young professional” would be every bit as myopic as putting too much emphasis on attracting tourism or attracting a particular industry or company to town. It tends to be short-sighted, and it runs the risk of making your town too much like everywhere else. </p><p>Speaking of which, the “young professionals” conversation centers a lot around Epic Systems employees, and again, while Epic and the consulting businesses around it are a big part of the local economy, it’s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.isthmus.com/madland/article.php?article=42193" target="_blank">irresponsible</a> to center one’s thinking too much on any one company or industry. Not every young person I know who works at Epic (or in tech generally) is alike, or has the same set of ideas about what they want from life in Madison. Plus, as Madison’s tech sector grows, we should be having an open conversation about how to avoid the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/05/us/driven-from-silicon-valleys-jungle-homeless-face-limited-options.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">economic disparities</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/billboards-of-semi-nude-brogrammers-are-lining-silicon-1660933261" target="_blank">cultural tackiness</a> that tech has bred in areas like Silicon Valley. I think we’re good enough to do that, and we have tech companies and leaders who set a good example with community-minded projects like the Yahara Music Library (a partnership between the startup Murfie and the Madison Public Library). </p><p>So when we talk about attracting “young professionals,” let’s think about attracting the “young professionals” who share the values that make Madison special. And beware of people who complain that Madison is "<a href="http://www.madisonmagazine.com/Madison-Magazine/October-2013/The-Tier-Two-Tradeoff/" target="_blank">too small for a Container Store</a>."</p><p>I also am not against all new development. I think the Constellation on East Wash is a cool-looking building (though I worry about the effect such buildings will have on housing costs and rents in the area), and I like Sujeo, the locally owned restaurant on its first floor. It’s just a fact that we need more housing, more density, and more ways for people to live in central Madison. I also&nbsp;like Merchant, whose owners are partners in&nbsp;<a href="http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/city-life/downtown-entertainment-district-hatches-a-million-boutique-hotel-restaurant-and/article_1d71c473-fc7e-5c66-bd55-6562b54790b4.html" target="_blank">the new “lifestyle boutique hotel” proposed for King Street</a>. They’ve made the case that “young professionals” will be staying there, of course, and I’m betting it will be a successful business. </p><p>If everyone would please stop saying “lifestyle boutique hotel” (and the demon-conjuring “luxury student apartments") I would probably be a bit less cranky, but I’m not here to say they shouldn’t go ahead with building this, and I'm not writing this as&nbsp;a takedown of any particular development. In fact, I agree that there is a market for this, and maybe I’ll end up enjoying the bar, restaurant, and venue planned for the building. Plus, with apologies to the truly wonderful Restaurant Muramoto and Natt Spil, it’s not as if King Street has some charming flavor that I’m worried about ruining. </p><p>That said, having this and other new developments justified in terms of “young professionals” doesn’t really resonate with me. Because people who are young and professional in this town have a range of tastes, experiences, and reasons to be in Madison. I don’t aspire to have a condo downtown, and the, er, lifestyle that often comes along with a condo downtown has always struck me as tacky and regressive. (If you ask who I am to declare what is tacky, keep in mind that I'm from Florida. My tackiness radar is near-infallible.) My girlfriend and I bought a fixer-upper house in the Eastmorland neighborhood (basically, head east on Milwaukee Street past Fair Oaks Avenue) last year. It turned out to be a great deal for us, and we have great neighbors, ranging from other people in their 30s to retirees in their 70s. I’m happy about this, because if all my neighbors were other “young professionals,” I don’t know who would lend me power tools. That's right, I like my lame homebody stuff as much as I like going out to shows. My neighborhood is almost entirely single-family homes, and I’m not as close as I’d like to be to all the things I like in Madison, but guess what? I’m in Madison, which means I’m never really all that far from anything else in Madison. Like the proverbial “young professional,” I’d like to be able to walk, bike, and bus to more things, but I don’t feel I’ve really sacrificed too much in that respect. In fact, I think we should balance more central development with expanding transit access in the slightly-less-central parts of town.</p><p>A lot of other “young professional” families share this experience. This is a good thing. In the long run, we as a city should make sure young people see buying houses in places like the east side and the north side as just as good an option as living in new buildings downtown. Starting a business in a not-quite-central neighborhood should be considered as good an option as going to work in the tech sector (even if not always as lucrative). </p><p>The development we’re seeing in Madison increasingly yields apartment buildings and other businesses that feel like they could’ve been plunked down in just about any mid-size city. Which, if I can reach a bit, means attracting people who’d be fine just about any place that has a certain baseline of amenities, and who don’t really care much about what makes Madison different from other cities. And let me be clear about something: I’m not worried about losing Madison as I imagine it might have been in the 1960s. I’m worried about watering down the things that make Madison special <em>today</em>. And at times people in Madison should be better about instigating and embracing change, but I think we’re smart enough and passionate enough to do that on our own terms. </p><p>Speaking of that baseline of amenities: A lot of cities have discovered craft cocktails, nice coffee places, nice restaurants, and even boutique hotels. Those things are all well and good (well, maybe not "boutique hotels”—I’m sorry, but if the very phrase doesn’t hurt your face a little, you may not be a natural-born human with a living soul), but they are never the entirety of what makes a city special. Yes, I love having a lot of awesome restaurants and coffee places, and Madison does it better than most, but lots of other cities have discovered those things too. And I’d point out that Madison’s success with restaurants and bars isn’t just a matter of recognizing the demand for good food and drink or following trends—instead it’s really a product of a local culture that cares deeply about supporting small businesses, trying new things, and embracing idiosyncrasy. For me, a craft-beer bar or a nice meal in Madison usually feels pretty special, whereas a similarly designed craft-beer bar or nice meal in Atlanta or Minneapolis or Nashville usually feels just-OK. A lot of people can do those things well, but people in Madison seem to have a special capacity for bringing off dining with a great balance of taste, expertise, and informality.</p><p>And this is why I get fussy and precious when it comes to Madison’s future—because this is the kind of city where something as simple as going out for dinner or a beer can remind me of the soul of the place, and why I love living here. The city is being rapidly transformed by people investing millions of dollars in development, and I believe that some of that will have a positive impact. But those of us who’ve invested more modest amounts into buying (or even renting) our homes are just as dedicated to the character and future of the city, if not more so. And when people talk about “young professionals,” they’re really talking about a certain set of tastes and aspirations. They’re not talking about us.</p>

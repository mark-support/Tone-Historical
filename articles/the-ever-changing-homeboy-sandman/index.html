      <p>
	If you're looking for one simple key, some shorthand, for 
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/homeboysandman" target="_blank">Homeboy Sandman</a>'s style and worldview, his discography so far will listen like a hail of clues that all point in different directions. Which doesn't mean that his output is scattered or frustrating. The New York City rapper, real name Angel Del Villar II, has put out about a dozen EPs and albums since 2007, and all this output finds him diving through a rich, ever-shifting internal universe that's always presenting him with conflicting ideas and impulses. To pull off both a song like “Illuminati" (from 2012's <em>First Of A Living Breed</em>) and a song like “America, The Beautiful" (from last year's <em>Hallways</em>), an artist has to not only be comfortable with a bit of contradiction, but perhaps fascinated with it, driven by it.
</p>
<p>
	If there's a constant, it's that Homeboy Sandman always tackles all this with hungry lyricism and dense flows that invite repeat listens and a bit of obsession. He'll be 
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/569983799769498/" target="_blank">opening up for Aesop Rock and Rob Sonic on Feb. 3 at the Barrymore</a>, and will have a tour-only tape for sale at the show. Before heading out on tour, he talked with us about some of the songs on <em>Hallways</em> and the crazy array of collaborators and tourmates he's racked up over the years.

	<strong>Tone Madison: So how was your 2014?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Homeboy Sandman:</strong> It was a great year. My niece turned 7, my nephew turned 6, me and Sosa, my DJ, went to Europe two different times, that was a lot of fun. <em>White Sands</em> came out at the beginning of the year before Hallways came out. A lot of great music, a lot of fun shows, we headlined a tour in the summertime with the Difference Machine in the U.S.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: On <em data-redactor-tag="em">Hallways</em>, was there anything you were trying to do differently? </strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Homeboy Sandman:</strong> I have increasing difficulty with that question. I mean, isn't every single thing different every single day? I have increasing difficulty with that question, because I think it exists within a context that, I don't know, is not my reality? Different things are happening in my life every single day, trying to be a better person every single day, trying to be a better rapper. I would never try to do something I've already done. I'm always trying to do new flows, talk about different concepts, talk about how I'm evolving, every single time. I'm always getting the question—my answer to that question is every single thing. That's the only answer I can have to that question about what is different—every single thing.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Were there any particular experiences or feelings that informed how you went about writing the songs on <em data-redactor-tag="em">Hallways</em>?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Homeboy Sandman:</strong> I think a track like “Grand Pupa" was driven by some realizations I had when I was in a relationship with a woman and it fizzled out much like a lot of my relationships have fizzled out, and it was an eye-opener for me, realizing some of the patterns, I guess, that have been taking place for a long time. It was a moment of clarity that led to the introspection that led to that song. “America The Beautiful" is a song that, ever since I was a kid and I went to the Dominican Republic, and I remember going to the capital where my father was raised and seeing real poverty. Like people living in sheds and shittin' in holes, and when it rained everybody inside's getting wet. I remember seeing real poverty and it impressing itself upon me at that time how even people who live in the United States who are always complaining and bitching really are just living in the lap of luxury compared to what I saw in D.R. That was definitely the inception for that song, which really came to fruition when I heard that beat from Jonwayne. It finally came out of me, stuff that I've been observing my whole life.

<p>
	<br>
	<strong>Tone Madison: And you've talked a lot before about being able to embody contradictions in your own life and reflect these changing points of view in your songs. It's introspective, but not in a moody way. It still has this playfulness to it.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Homeboy Sandman: </strong>Yeah, I definitely don't associate the word “introspective" with any kind of somberness or solemness or anything like that. It's definitely an important part of my life, and I'm blessed to be able to keep things positive no matter what's going on.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: “Personal Ad" is interesting in that respect. How did you come to write that song?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Homeboy Sandman:</strong> That song was inspired by a girl I started messing with, and I wrote it when I first started messing with her, in the first few days. We hit it off real quick, and in the first three or four days, I was in a  place where I was really enjoying the interaction that her and I were having, but I realized that I was also open to a lot of variety of interactions. And I was feeling in a good place, feeling very confident at the time, given how things was going with homegirl and I was feeling very open to lots of relationship-type stuff. The hook is like this “damn, leave a woman." “Grand Pupa" was more like a “yo what's going on, I'm wilin' over here." “Personal Ad" was more playful like “alright, I'm just enjoying this," but keeping in mind that cycle, of things always coming to an end at some point.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: What was it like making “Enough" with J-Live and Kurious? I know you'd done things <a href="https://mortiermusic.bandcamp.com/track/fitness-f-homeboy-sandman" target="_blank">before</a> with J-Live.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Homeboy Sandman:</strong> I actually had that beat for a really long time. The brother that made it, Inspirementalist, I guess he must have given me that beat four or five years ago, and I always loved it, but for whatever reason I just didn't write to it. I didn't feel like it was the right time or something like that. But when I had the inspiration to write my verse—I don't know what it was about that, you know, because “Enough" is like Slick Rick, how he starts off “Mona Lisa." J I've been a fan of for a long time. I think it really speaks to a lot of the shortcomings of how hip hop is regarded as a genre as an art form, that J-Live isn't one of the more celebrated artists to ever come cross in the genre—he's definitely one of the most creative and the most skilled. And then Kurious I've been a fan of since I was a young kid. I was looking for the right opportunity to involve him in something. As a person, he's such a solid person, and it fell together perfectly, with having two guys who I've looked up to for a long time, and have Kurious have the last verse on my album. The whole thing is a bit of a nod to Slick Rick, who's another one of my favorites. The beat I feel is very beautiful but it's very sparse. It really allows the different MCs to showcase how it is they get down. I wanted two dudes that would be able to handle the burden of having a beat that's really beautiful but isn't overwhelming, so I'm going to need the verses to really shine.

	<strong>Tone Madison: I like that line, “think the president is half-lizard," because you say that and then there's no return to that thought, ever. It's just this weird little grace note. It just makes you think of David Icke or whatever for a second, and then the song is on to something else.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Homeboy Sandman: </strong>[Laughs.] Yeah, that verse to me was a lot of different details of what was going on in my brain.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: And speaking of the collaborations on this album, how did you end up doing “Unravelling" with the lute player Jozef Van Wissem?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Homeboy Sandman:</strong> Oh man, that's a really crazy story. The first time I was in Europe, I had an off day in Liverpool. My friend Jenny was with me, and she was like, “Let's go to the movies. I want to see this movie called <em>Only Lovers Left Alive</em>." I hadn't heard about it, and she said, “Oh, it's a vampire movie, it's the new Jim Jarmusch." We went and checked it out, and I thought the movie was fly but I thought the music was fly. I loved the music. I came to find out it was the lute, but it was a stringed instrument and there was so much atmosphere in the music. I left being like, “Yo, the movie was fly but that music was fly!" That's what I was saying leaving. And then me, you know, I sublet when I'm home in New York, because I be on the road now and I don't have very many possessions so it makes more sense to sublet. I'm about to be gone for three months and even when I come back I'm only there for another month. I was looking for a sublet, and sure enough who's subletting—When I'm writing my little thing I'm like “Yo I'm Angel, I'm a musician, Homeboy Sandman, check my shit out, I'm looking for a sublet," and this dude shouts me back and he's like, “Oh, I'm a musician too. My name is Jozef Van Wissem." It's his spot in Brooklyn! And then he had his little link to his music. I went and checked it out and come to find out he's the dude who did the music. I'm like, “Yo, my man, I just watched that shit, that shit is crazy." And then he's like, “It's crazy too," because an article had just come out talking about some underrated shit that included me as the MC—they had different categories and I was the hip-hop dude and Jozef Van Wissem was the composer that was underrated. So I had just heard of him and he had just heard of me. And I was finishing up the record at that time and he became a fan of my shit and I already was a fan of his. So he was like, “Yo, let's work on some shit," and then once we did it, I was like, “Yo, this shit got a vibe." Like, that vibe, I've never heard a rap record that I thought sounded like that, and that was a new vibe and a unique vibe and it brought out all these rhymes.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: You've toured with an interesting assortment of artists at different times, including Brother Ali and Cunninlynguists, for instance, which right there represents two pretty different styles. Do you pride yourself on being able to link up with a variety of artists?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Homeboy Sandman: </strong>Yeah, I think that what you'll be able to say, you'll always be able to say where the people are from and that they're very distinctive. Cunninlynguists, very distinctive. Brother Ali, very distinctive. Aesop Rock,  very distinctive. So it's a blessing to be invited to rock with them. Tours that I've done on my own or that I've gone last, I had Open Mike Eagle, very distinctive. Ain't nobody else like him. Then I had The Difference Machine, and they're very distinctive. I'm a musician. I love original music. I think the hip hop people that I'm going to connect with and people that I appreciate and who appreciate my stuff are people who really value creativity and authenticity and uniqueness. So yeah, I don't think there's any artist that's like me. There's people making hip-hop, but I'm one of one. I love these people that are one of one. I think these people that I've named are one of one. That's what I value. You saw, I'm a little sensitive to certain things, I'm a little sensitive to people asking me certain questions. I'm very sensitive to people asking me about an artist, or about a rap act that is nowhere near being a one-of-one act, and I'm like, “You'd be better off comparing me to, I don't know, an electrician or something like that." What I do is one-of-one stuff, and the people I build with, they're that way too. “Oh, Cunninlynguists and Homeboy Sandman—those are not similar acts," but that's because there are no similar Homeboy Sandman acts, there are no similar Brother Ali acts, and there are no similar Aesop Rock acts, even though I will say that Aesop's got a lot of biters, but can't nobody really bite him, because he's bite-proof, because that's who nice he is. The Cunninlynguists, that was the first real tour that I did, and I learned so much from those dudes, just from watching how they get down. They're genuine-article cats.

	<strong>Tone Madison: You've made a lot of records in the last six years or so. What have been some of the really important or formative experiences you've had in making all that music?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Homeboy Sandman: </strong>My music, my art, is something I'm addicted to doing. I gotta create. It's what makes me feel strong and confident, and it makes me feel useful. But relationships are obviously one thing, my faith in God is something that is inspiring me constantly. I mean, I've had different things. Society has been a real driving force, things I see and ways I feel at different times have been a driving force for a lot of things I created. Less so where I'm at right now, and I feel like that's a good thing. If you look at a song “Activity," I've tried to streamline my language at different times, I've tried to streamline my diet at different times. There've been times I wouldn't go onto the train unless it was the last seat on the last car—that was some superstition I was dealing with. I wrote with my left hand for an entire year, and I'm right-handed. Just wilin' stuff, you know? It's just my life. The birth of my niece and nephew and watching them grow has been something that's really made me look at the world in a new way. I almost became a father myself. That was a big thing and that was a faith thing. There's been a lot of things, but those are some of them.

      <p>
	By the time Madison band <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Vanishing-Kids/328568887984" target="_blank">Vanishing Kids</a> released its fourth album, last year's <a href="http://vanishingkids.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><em>Spirit Visions</em></a>, a lot of the songs were already several years old. Moving from Madison to Portland and back again, and having a child, slowed things down for singer/keyboardist Nikki Drohomyreky and guitarist Jason Hartman, but the album succeeded in creating an intoxicating mix of post-punk, pop and hard-rock influences. Over the years the married couple (the only two permanent members of the band so far) have found it natural to meld together disparate sounds. The album embraces a few different modes of stabbing, dissonant guitar, as you'll hear on on "Heathen Heart," and a more tender, melodic approach on songs like "Spirit Grow." Yet the band also sneaks a cohesive feel into it all, thanks to Drohomyreky's dramatic vocals and a production style that embraces the sonic messiness just enough.</p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3206273052/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=1220151520/transparent=true/" width="300" height="150" seamless="">
&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href="http://vanishingkids.bandcamp.com/album/spirit-visions"&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Spirit Visions by V A N I S H I N G K I D S&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
</iframe><p>
	<br>Over the past year, Drohomyreky has been writing new songs and Hartman has been touring with Madison doom-metal outfit Jex Thoth. The two have also been spending more time writing and practicing with VK's new lineup, with bassist Jerry Sofran and drummer Terry Nugent. <a href="%20http-/www.high-noon.com/event/584365-il-sogno-del-marinaio-mike-madison/index.html" target="_blank">This Monday they'll open for Mike Watt's newest band, Il Sogno Del Marinaio, at the High Noon Saloon</a>. Hartman and Drohomyreky met up with me this week to discuss how Vanishing Kids is changing.</p><p><strong>
Tone Madison: How is your sound changing as you write new songs?</strong></p><p><strong>
Nikki Drohomyreky: </strong>I've been writing a lot of dreamy pop stuff. It's more pop-y, in terms of it's more of a 1-2-3 format and big choruses. To me, it sounds like Vanishing Kids, but the new stuff isn't quite as progressive or as weird, probably.</p><p>
<strong>Jason Hartman: </strong>We're trying to simplify a little bit.</p><p>
<strong>Nikki Drohomyreky: </strong>But Jason always puts his twist on it, and our drummer's pretty progressive-sounding. He always shreds, probably too much, really, but he's a metal dude, so that changes it, too. But that's what's coming out, trying to create more of a mood, I guess. Jerry is making us more psychedelic, because he's really into old psych. Jason's rig has completely changed, too. I think it sounds very '70s.</p><p>
<strong>Jason Hartman: </strong>I think our sound in general is more organic now. There's more organ and less synth.</p><p><strong>
Tone Madison: But when you say the guitar has become more '70s-sounding, what does that mean?</strong></p><p><strong>
Jason Hartman:</strong> I guess I'm playing more older gear than I used to play. I'm playing a Les Paul now, which I never did. That was kind of a Jex thing. I've always liked the tone of them, but they're not the easiest guitar for me to play. I'm used to Strat-style or more '80s-style guitars. I bought an old tube amp. So all my stuff's really old now and it's affecting the sound some.</p><p>
<strong>Nikki Drohomyreky:</strong> It totally is. You're using tons of effects, but to me the guitar sounds really fresh, and as a songwriter that's exciting.</p><p><strong>
Tone Madison: Would you say the guitar is taking on a warmer sound, then?</strong></p><p><strong>
Jason Hartman: </strong>Yeah. I mean I've always had tube amps, but it's just an older one. I got a 1969 Ampeg. Now my sound is looser, I feel like. It's hard to play the older stuff with the new gear, because to re-create those sounds, it doesn't sound the same. And the songs on 'Spirit Visions,' that album is actually really old. As it is, we started to record it in 2007, so some of the songs are from 2005.</p><p>
<strong>Nikki Drohomyreky:&nbsp;</strong>It just took us so long because it was so expensive.</p><p>
<strong>Jason Hartman:</strong> And then we had a kid, so we didn't even release it until 2013.</p><p>
<strong>Nikki Drohomyreky: </strong>I think that's part of the reason I'm so inspired, too, is because I had so much time off from just being with inundated with it in Portland, where everyone I knew was writing music and making records, and it was just in your face non-stop. And then just being thrown into this mom role, which was such a trip—I think now it's just pouring out of me because I've had such a break.</p><p>
<strong>Jason Hartman:</strong> We're both writing stuff, but her stuff is more solid. She'll have a keyboard line and then a vocal line and everything, and all the parts are together, whereas I tend to write riffs.</p><p><strong>
Tone Madison: In a city like Portland it's maybe easier to feel like you're in the thick of things, but sometimes it's healthier be away from that.</strong></p><p><strong>
Nikki Drohomyreky: </strong>It's just a sea of musicians. Every time we play a show we're playing to the same 10 friends. There's just too many shows to pick from and so many great musicians.</p><p>
<strong>Jason Hartman: </strong>It's really cool at first, because you can see anything you want to see all the time, but then after a while it just becomes—</p><p>
<strong>Nikki Drohomyreky:</strong> It takes the special-ness out of it a little bit. So for me, I think spiritually I needed that break. I was getting jaded. The thing that I love the most, I was becoming sick of it. It's a different perspective, too, as a mother. I think Madison's such a rad place to raise a kid.</p><p><strong>
Tone Madison: In your music there's this combination of pop, and some '80s post-punk and also some metal. How did that come together?</strong></p><p><strong>
Jason Hartman:</strong> I think we just have weird taste in music, really. When I got into music I was playing in a lot of metal bands, in the early '90s and stuff. But the first album I bought was Queen&nbsp;and they mix so many genres together.</p><p><strong>
Tone Madison: Which Queen album?</strong></p><p><strong>
Jason Hartman: </strong>The first one I bought was Queen's greatest&nbsp;hits, because it had "We Are The Champions And We Will Rock You," but <em>News Of The World</em>&nbsp;is the one that I grew up on. But the greatest&nbsp;hits also has the Flash Gordon song. And I ended up getting all the Queen albums. But I think I grew up with a lot of bands that did that. Jane's Addiction was another big influence, and they mixed, you know, glammy rock and metal with funk and goth and all kinds of stuff. And then I also liked metal on its own, and post-punk.I always loved The Cure, too.</p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/m9kCCLwEga8" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen">
</iframe><p>
<br><strong>Nikki Drohomyreky:</strong> We both love hooks, but we love shredding too, and it's always kind of come through. And it's the two personalities writing, so that definitely creates a fusion of sound.</p><p>
<strong>Jason Hartman: </strong>But when we first started the band, it was more post-punk. We were really getting into Cocteau Twins.</p><p><strong>
Tone Madison: You said the new songs having more of a pop feel. Where does the pop inspiration come from for you?</strong></p><p><strong>
Nikki Drohomyreky: </strong>My favorite band is Celebration, which is probably evident in my vocals. I do love Beach House. I love how it's very monochromatic and I don't have to think about it. A lot of stuff you really listen to and dissect it. I don't do that with Beach House, I just put it on and enjoy it and it puts me on a mood. I think that's coming through in this new record—I probably listened to too much Beach House, to drive Jason mental. I love Kate Bush.</p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oTkBZ93z3P0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen">
</iframe><p>
<br><strong>Jason Hartman: </strong>You also listen to T. Rex obsessively.</p><p>
<strong>Nikki Drohomyreky: </strong>I don't think we sound like T. Rex at all, though. I love Glass Candy. I like The Knife a lot. I think you'll hear the Beach House element a little bit.</p><p><strong>
Tone Madison: Does Jason's touring with Jex Thoth rub off on Vanishing Kids at all, or is that kind of a separate compartment?</strong></p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/scdNcZeezyo?list=PL_O96RYZvdVzAzr-zpZC4E_36Px57L4Oo" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen">
</iframe><p>
<br><strong>Nikki Drohomyreky:</strong> Yes, the sound has, definitely. Which is kind of rad. He's a very progressive player, but he's playing simpler, and laying back. I think that that is somewhat of an influence for sure. But she influences me too, and I think she's an amazing performer.</p><p>
<strong>Jason Hartman: </strong>But [laying back] is what you want me to do!</p><p>
<strong>Nikki Drohomyreky:</strong> I'm trying to get everybody to lay back. I'm trying to create a dreamy sound.</p><p><strong>
Tone Madison: Any other plans for this show, aside from&nbsp;playing some new songs?</strong></p><p><strong>
Nikki Drohomyreky:</strong> Brian Steele is going to do a harmony with me on the first song. We're going to start the show with just the vocals and guitar. And we have a performance artist playing with us on one track.</p><p>
<strong>Jason Hartman: </strong>We want to kind of include more of our friends in the performances. I'd like to get DB Pedersen in there again. He was on a couple of songs on the <em>Skies In Your Eyes</em> album.</p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2997972680/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=2858053224/transparent=true/" width="300" height="150" seamless="">
&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href="http://vanishingkids.bandcamp.com/album/skies-in-your-eyes"&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Skies in Your Eyes by V A N I S H I N G K I D S&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
</iframe><p>
<strong><br>Nikki Drohomyreky:</strong> We lived with him for a minute, and it was like living with the <em>Police Academy</em> guy.</p><p><strong>
Tone Madison: Right, that's how I know he's around. "Who the hell's making those weird bird sounds?"</strong></p><p><strong>
Nikki Drohomyreky:</strong> But he's actually a really prolific musician. He's always writing.</p><p><strong>
Tone Madison: I haven't seen Brian Steele play music since his metal band Wife was still together.</strong></p><p><strong>
Jason Hartman:</strong> I think it makes it more fun for the community, to see different people acting together. I think that Second Family Band thing is cool, because it's always a mystery who you're going to see, and it's neat to have that mystery. I want to do that at every show.</p>

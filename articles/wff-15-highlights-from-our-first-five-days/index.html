	After this year's Wisconsin Film Festival wraps up on Thursday night, we'll be taking a look back at the experience as a whole. For now, we've got a few notes on what's been striking us at WFF screenings.
</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://guide.wifilmfest.org/2015/Event.aspx?id=3364" target="_blank"><em>Kurt Cobain: Montage Of Heck</em></a>
</p>
<p>
	[<i>Spoiler alert: Some details about how this documentary handles Kurt Cobain's death</i>.] Brett Morgen's new two-hour documentary lives up to the massive anticipation around it with a tactful, deliberate approach to the life of Kurt Cobain, from his unstable childhood to the conflicted success of Nirvana. Cobain's daughter Frances Bean Cobain (who is credited as an executive producer but appears here only in home videos, as a baby) gave Morgen access to a trove of Cobain's journals, videos, and home recordings, and the only interviews are with the people who were close to him in life (or, in the case of Cobain's father and stepmother, were supposed to be close to him but for some reason never quite succeeded). That means no journalists or bloviating cultural commentators get the chance to dilute the film's intimacy. The film goes through Cobain's life in chronological order, and when Cobain dies by suicide, that's the end. No post-analysis, no conjecture about the whys. And that's powerful, because it means that basically every part of the film is framed around something that came from Cobain or his family, whether that's a fully realized Nirvana masterpiece like "Scentless Apprentice," a drawing, or a home video of Cobain and Courtney Love goofing off. Much like the Rodriguez documentary <em>Searching For Sugar Man</em>,<em> Kurt Cobain: </em><em>Montage Of Heck</em> also deftly uses animation to tie the music to a senss of place. And even with unprecedented access, Morgen doesn't presume to give us an authoritative interpretation of Cobain—instead, he lets us revel in the contradictions, the turbulence, and the extraordinary music, and the result is as moving as it is revealing. —SG

</p>
<p>
	This screens again on Tuesday night and I absolutely recommend catching it. Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland's 2014 thriller delivers on its promise of sick-minded laughs, but doesn't trivialize its subject too much. Stellan Skarsgard stars as a quiet man who drives a big fuck-off snowplow, dutifully keeping his small town's roads clear until his son is murdered by drug dealers. He starts killing off members of the drug ring, shooting his way up higher into the ranks toward its petulant, effete leader (a show-stealing Pål Sverre Hagen). But despite the comically brutal choreography of the killings, we also get a sense of the emptiness of revenge—unlike, say, <em>Inglourious Bastards</em>, <em>In Order Of Disappearance</em> doesn't really seem to look for moral satisfaction in any of this. If anything, it creates situations that make you question whether Skarsgard's pursuit is really worth it. Instead, Moland embraces the comic possibilities of mindless, hapless violence, and that is satisfying, though it'll put you off paragliding for a while.  —SG
</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://guide.wifilmfest.org/2015/Program.aspx?id=3045" target="_blank">Enough To Make You Mad: Experimental Short Films</a>
</p>
<p>
	Every year, I urge anyone and everyone going to WFF to check out at least one program of short films. Seriously, just throw a dart in the direction of the short-film programs, and you'll see stuff you'll likely never have a chance to see in a theater again. In this case, I can say I've seen a bedsheet ghost-person vomiting on himself (the sheet got vomit on it, of course) in Jean-Paul Kelly's short <em>Service Of The Goods</em>, and beautifully violent blurs of animation and video experimentation in Karen Yasinsky's shorts <em>Audition</em> and <em>Life Is an Opinion, Fire a Fact</em>. (Side note: You should really be able to place bets on the walkouts that occur during these screenings. Number, frequency, which films will prove the last straw for the most people, etc.) On the way out of this program on Friday night at the Chazen, I ran into Madison filmmaker <a href="http://www.tonemadison.com/articles/aaron-granat-on-making-videos-of-people-looking-at-art/" target="_blank">Aaron Granat</a>, who told me, “I feel a little abused, but that's how you're supposed to feel after an experimental-film program." Pretty much. — SG

	The film fest sadly started late this year for me. I literally landed, dropped my bags off at home, and high tailed it to Sundance today and submerged myself to atone for the films I had to miss. Monday night, I poured one out for <em>Kurt Cobain:</em> <em>Montage Of Heck</em>, <em><a href="http://guide.wifilmfest.org/2015/Event.aspx?id=3296" target="_blank">Felt</a></em>, <em><a href="http://guide.wifilmfest.org/2015/Event.aspx?id=3340" target="_blank">Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead</a></em>, <em><a href="http://guide.wifilmfest.org/2015/Event.aspx?id=3388" target="_blank">The End Of The Tour</a></em>, and a dozen other highly anticipated films I was unable to catch. I'd like to think I hit the ground running with my first night of movies through.
</p>
<p>
	I went into Naji Abu Nowar's film <em>Theeb</em> pretty much blind, and it paid off spectacularly. In the grand scheme of my day, Theeb came off as the slightest feature with small cast and sparse yet overpoweringly gorgeous setting, but it played its scant hand so well and won me over completely by the end. Eleven-year-old Theeb, a Bedouin boy, more or less stows away on a dangerous journey with his older brother and, over the course of the coming-of-age story, they encounter a great many dangers and tragedies. There's a certain kind of gauzy magic that subtly creeps into the frames of the film. I found myself fondly recalling the waking dreaminess of <em>Pan's Labyrinth</em> and, like that film, <em>Theeb</em> is very much grounded in a brutal reality, but it's not one that the protagonist is recoiling from. —CL

	What do you get when you add <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> levels of social awkwardness to an otherwise over-the-top bonkers action flick? Something special indeed, it turns out. South Korean director Kim Seong-hun's outlandish tale of a corrupt cop with a heart of gold (or at least a kid who likes awesome toys?) finding himself in over his head after he creatively dispenses with the body of his accidental hit-and-run victim goes from crazy to crazier, effortlessly blending deeply awkward comedy elements with insane action sequences and occasionally even actual police work. I was extremely pleased with how each little elaborate mousetrap of a gag or plot device was set up, incorporated into the narrative, and finally ended up paying off with aplomb. There were too many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun" target="_blank">Chekovian guns</a> built into this thing to even count, but each one (figurative and literal) hit their intended targets with ease by the end of the third act. —CL

	<em><a href="http://guide.wifilmfest.org/2015/Event.aspx?id=3353" target="_blank">The Astrologer</a></em>

	We were blessed to have actor Pat Healy (<em>Cheap Thrills</em>, <em>The Innkeepers</em>) <a href="https://twitter.com/TotesChris/status/587798888498733056" target="_blank">in attendance</a>, and his introduction to Craig Denney's 1975 film <em>The Astrologer</em> amounted to the equivalent of a sober-sitter guiding first-time drug-dabblers through the ups and downs of an acid trip. Along with <em><a href="http://guide.wifilmfest.org/2015/Event.aspx?id=3389" target="_blank">Roar</a></em>, <em>The Astrologer</em> is absolutely in the realm of “WTF" movies, where part of the enjoyment is in the profoundly awkward and poorly thought out yet ultimately charming (-ish?) execution. It's not a good film, by any stretch of the imagination, but the sheer volume of sincerely wrong-headed decisions that went into producing this film turns it into something of a car wreck I have no regret about rubbernecking at least once in my life. Sadly, the folks in the audience tonight will be some of the only people to ever laugh at (not with) <em>The Astrologer</em>, since no one bothered to clear the vast quantities of Moody Blues tunes that act as the de facto soundtrack, thus making any sort of legitimate re-release financially implausible. —CL

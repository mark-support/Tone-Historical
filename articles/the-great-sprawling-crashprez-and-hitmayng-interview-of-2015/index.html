      <p><em>Pictured:&nbsp;CRASHprez (left) and *hitmayng. Photo by Kenneth La'Ron.</em></p><p>
	Two of the most frenetically productive musicians in Madison recently have been 20-year-old Michael Penn II, who raps under the name&nbsp;
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CRASHprez" target="_blank">CRASHprez</a>, and 24-year-old Ian Carroll, who produces and DJs under the name&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/hitmayng" target="_blank">*hitmayng</a>. They began collaborating with a 2012 EP called&nbsp;<a href="https://hitmayng.bandcamp.com/album/enjoy-your-miserable-life" target="_blank"><em>Enjoy Your Miserable Life</em></a>, and went on to make last year’s&nbsp;<a href="https://catchwreckcollective.bandcamp.com/album/fear-itself" target="_blank"><em>Fear Itself</em></a> EP, all while playing a lot of live shows (including opening slots for such artists as Danny Brown and Riff Raff) and bringing together a diverse range of electronic and hip-hop artists through the&nbsp;<a href="https://catchwreckcollective.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Catch Wreck</a> label and music collective. In fact, *hitmayng was the only artist, and Catch Wreck the only label, to show up twice on our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tonemadison.com/articles/tone-madisons-top-20-madison-records-of-2014/" target="_blank">top 20 Madison records of 2014 list</a>—once for <em>Fear Itself</em> and again for&nbsp;<a href="https://catchwreckcollective.bandcamp.com/album/sleepers" target="_blank"><em>Sleepers</em></a>, a collection of ambient tracks by Carroll and three other artists, including fellow Madison producer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Kiazma" target="_blank">Kiazma</a>. Both are also UW-Madison students: Carroll is doing grad work in clinical psychology; Penn is a junior majoring in journalism and also a pretty fierce writer, as his&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@crashprez/bobby-shmurda-is-not-y-our-nigger-dc2d8dc155e6" target="_blank">recent essay on Bobby Shmurda</a> attests.</p><p>
	As far as I can tell, 
	<em>Fear Itself</em> is pretty much a guileless reflection of these two personalities. As an MC, CRASHprez is unapologetically provocative and determined to grapple with the social and political—the EP, released on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day last year features a crucified MLK on the cover, and the song “Do Something” is a brutal take on frequent police and vigilante killings of unarmed black men—but he’s also whimsical and playful, and in these songs it’s not always entirely clear which part is which, or when the change happened. *hitmayng’s production is also a bit all over the place, but in a more reserved, methodical way. All this also basically sums up what it’s like to talk with these two. “No one ever really knows how to feel about me,” Penn said when we first met. To which Carroll replied: “Well, you’re, like, a lot!"</p><iframe src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2905239417/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=4020459080/transparent=true/" seamless="">
&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href="http://catchwreckcollective.bandcamp.com/album/fear-itself"&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;fear itself. by CRASHprez &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; *hitmayng&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
</iframe><p>
	In 2015, CRASHprez is planning to release his first full-length solo album, 
	<em>More Perfect</em>, as well as another collaborative EP with *hitmayng. Beyond that, *hitmayng’s plans include an upcoming split cassette with fellow producer Eli Colburn, as well as marshaling a bunch more releases and collaborations on Catch Wreck. The two met up with me at the end of December to discuss their collaborations, their sprawling musical tastes and how they’ve both grown as artists. Despite its length, this interview reflects only about a half-hour of conversation, so… yeah.</p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/180447909&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false">
</iframe><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: When you started making music together, was it really collaborative off the bat, or more just Michael working with beats Ian already made?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll:</strong> There was feedback, but it was less collaborative than it is now. We’re more comfortable, so we can give each other more brutal feedback.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>I guess he must have not thought I was sus back then, because Ian don’t try to fuck with nobody musically. He tries to keep it small.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll:</strong> I don’t like forcing relationships. I don’t like working with people if I’m not cool with them.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>Let’s build, Scott! You write a blog? I write too!</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll:</strong> A lot of those relationships can be superficial, and you can tell in the music, so I’m not really a fan of that at all. If people approach me and want to do music, I’ll be like, “Yeah, sure, approach me again,” and if I hang out with them and there’s some sort of energy, I’ll approach them, but most people, if they keep it a real weird, business-y relationship—but with Michael it was super cool because we just hung out, and it just worked.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>This man’s 24, and I’m 20, still.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll:</strong> That is pretty crazy. But yeah, before then I was just selling a lot of beats because it paid for my bills, so that was kind of when I was like, “Nah, I’m not gonna sell beats as much.” Because I was DJing more, so I didn’t have to sell beats. So I was spending more time giving people who I wanted to work with beats, instead of random people off MySpace.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II:</strong> I came into Wisconsin at age 17, dude. Just all out here young wild in the field. That was when <em>Goblin</em> first came out, that was when <em>Section.80</em> came out. Then I got really into <em>Veckatimest</em> that summer, too.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>So we connected on stuff like that, Radiohead, Grizzly Bear. We have the whole appreciation for a lot of different stuff, not just rap. We can go back and forth about conversations on different stuff. I might not necessarily bump Trinidad James, and you might not necessarily bump, I don’t know, Tim Hecker, right?</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>I kind of want to get into Tim Hecker, though.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>Well, yeah, see, that’s the thing. We trade back and forth a lot, and it slowly creeps in. Like, he listens to Grouper now.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II:</strong> The one time I was asleep and I was sad, and I woke up and I heard “Mind Mischief” playing from his room.&nbsp;I thought I woke up in heaven, so I got into Tame Impala.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>There aren’t a lot of people who are super into a lot of different types of music. Especially in rap, there are very few people who are into a lot of different music other than rap. And same thing with a lot of other forms of electronic music—there are very few people who are into things outside of their little niche, which kinda sucks.</p><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Right—it’s so much more fun to be into a lot of different things. </strong></p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>When I was raised, I used to listen to a lot of R&amp;B, a lot of bossa nova, a lot of disco, a lot of rap—just everything.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>New Rick Ross mixtape name: <em>BOSS-a Nova</em>. There we go. Definitely Tweeting that shit. Definitely writing that down. My early musical tastes—I’m from Maryland, I’m not even from this fuckin’ region, but the rap I first cared about was Atmosphere, Brother Ali and POS and shit. I was really into MF Doom, and Charles Hamilton, but then I ended up here somehow. I was just at the Doomtree blowout last month. That shit was fucking weird. A lot of my life and art is kind of around completion and shit, like going in circles and ending up places. We’re running circles around these lames, you feel me?!</p><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: There’s a lot of variety on <em>Fear Itself</em>. Was that deliberate or did it just kind of turn out that way?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II:</strong> Hasthag cohesion, dot dot dot question mark! We just talked about this!</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>I’d say it was deliberate, for sure. I make so much music across a lot of different domains, and he hears a lot of it, from all over the place. The last beat, that ended up being the song “Aaron McGruder,” you heard that and you loved it and I was like, ”Why the fuck do you like that?” I never pictured him rapping on it. I knew going into another project with him—our projects have always been kind of all over the place, but like, still, it makes sense. It was deliberate for sure. I would get really bored if that whole EP sounded like any of those beats over and over again.</p><iframe src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2905239417/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3755576897/transparent=true/" seamless="">
&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href="http://catchwreckcollective.bandcamp.com/album/fear-itself"&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;fear itself. by CRASHprez &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; *hitmayng&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
</iframe><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>He gets more of the liberty as a producer to go all over the fucking place, but we would always have early arguments about, “I want to have a sound and a consistency, but I don’t want people to be able to pin me down, like, ‘Oh, that’s a Crash beat,’ or ‘Oh, that’s something he’s gonna rap about.’”</p><p>
	I’m a Kanye fan, right? So, Kanye, you know what the fuck a Kanye record sounds like, but all that shit sounds different, but you still know it’s a Ye record. If I can go for that type of aesthetic consistency, that’s what I would want. After putting out 
	<em>Enjoy Your Miserable Life</em>, I put out<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="http://music.crashprez.com/album/masters-martyrs" target="_blank"><em>Masters And Martyrs</em></a>, which was me and Kiazma, which was completely fucking left-field and had nothing to do with my aesthetic shit at all. It was just like, “Hey, let’s make an EP together.” And he made me these five or six beats and I stared at them and went, “I don’t know what to fucking do with these,” and then a couple months later it clicked and I just did it, and that’s what it was.</p><iframe src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1031753432/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3043529298/transparent=true/" seamless="">
&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href="http://music.crashprez.com/album/masters-martyrs"&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;masters&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;martyrs by CRASHprez &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Kiazma&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
</iframe><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>We used to argue over you not wanting to have a sound and being like, “I can rap over anything,” and me saying, “You know, a release that’s eclectic still has to be cohesive sonically,” and that’s kind of the compromise we came to on <em>Fear Itself</em>.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>And <em>More Perfect</em> is definitely the closest thing to that so far.</p><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: And<em> More Perfect</em> isn’t just Ian’s producing, right?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>No. I’m calling it an album.

Six or seven people, but I know all these people and have relationships with all these people, all from the same camp.</p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/165169409&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false">

	<strong>Ian Carroll:</strong> That’s kind of been a cool thing with Catch Wreck. Catch Wreck as a greater collective aims to link folks who may not have linked. Eli Colburn’s one of those guys who’s my homie that I met on the Internet years and years ago through a mutual friend. He’s working in mastering records now but also in making beats. We have all these relationships with a bunch of people, and everyone’s just kind of connecting now off the Internet. But yeah, <em>More Perfect</em>’s more like a him solo thing and me trying to provide a bunch of creative direction.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>I’m at the point now where it’s like, I just want to finish this fucking record. The next shit we’re gonna do is gonna be fuckin’ stupid. I think this album’s definitely gonna push me to another level that I’m not at right now, because shit’s just starting to fall into place and doors are starting to open a little bit, so now I’ve gotta run through them. If this doesn’t tip me over to a new height that I envision it doing, the EP after that, we’ll definitely do that, and if that doesn’t do that, the album we’ll do eventually—I’m thinking ahead of motherfuckers. I’m thinking years ahead.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>The first we release we did was, what?</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>2012.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>Yeah. We’ve both grown a bunch, a bunch, a bunch. My beats sound way different.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>I had no facial hair. No bush.</p><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: And even <em>Fear Itself</em>, it’s been almost a year since that came out. How have you changed in the time since you completed it.</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>Oh, a ton. All those beats were like—</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>He hates them. He despises them.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll:</strong> They all took me, like—the longest beat was—</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>What, “Kill Me Dead”?</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll:</strong> That took me the longest to make and it didn’t take me more than 25 minutes.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>Still the best one, though.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll:</strong> All those beats were super short, and they all had sort of a point. The last beat [“Aaron McGruder"] took me the longest, but that was the only beat I didn’t think of in the context of this project. You were just like, “I want that beat,” and I said, “OK, sure.” But every other beat was super-short. I’ve learned a lot more about how to mix—I’m always learning about how to mix sounds and create sounds and I’ve gotten way better. Compositionally, I’ve gotten a lot better at that, and just figuring out how to blend our styles. For the longest time, I could never figure out what kind of beats you wanted, because it was kind of all over the place, but now I have a clear vision of what types of beats he’s really into. The other thing I’ve been thinking about a lot is how to make a pop record in the sense that people can connect to the beats I make on a really big scale. So trying to figure out the balance of, how much can I put myself in these beats but also do it so that lots of people can connect to it. We were talking about this last night, the whole ethos of pop and pop sentimentality in beats.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>Which fucked my head up. I thought about that the rest of the night.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll:</strong> Really? I told you, man. Thinking about pop records and the beauty of a pop record is that it connects to so many different types of people. It transcends so many different boundaries. I’ve thought about that a lot in my beats and how to take traditional rap structure and also take what I love in my beats and the creativity and fuse those things together and really do it in a way that it connects with a ton of people. We’re going to be connecting with people who are more like music snobs and underground hip-hop heads—</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>Oh, I could go off for like seven paragraphs about this—</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>But also connect to a broader audience that maybe listens to more, not commercial stuff, but you know what I mean? They don’t really pay a ton of attention to music, they don’t really dive in, but it’ll still appeal to them.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II:</strong> I’ve changed a lot. I feel like I had to go through more shit, for one. This year I went through more shit. And just always staying around with the community of people that I stay around and the people I affiliate myself with, where I’m always trying to compete, because that’s where I come from, that’s the nature of having a crop full of ill people that are ill at a lot of shit—ill together, the best, but some people are iller than others at certain shit, so it’s like you’re trying to build off each other but you’re also trying to fuck each other up. It used to be about, like, “Three of these people are about to get on this song, I’m about to fuck up both of y’all, you can’t fuck with me.” That’s the sort of mindset I came out of. Now I feel like I’m way more at a point to be a better collaborator than usual, because even if it’s not just what I’m doing, I try to curate. Like, when I make albums and get beats, I select it and I’m curating already who I’d hear on certain shit, on certain parts. I feel like I’ve developed more of that vocabulary, to just place and know when to reel myself back and where certain people will shine on certain shit, which is why there’s so many features on More Perfect. I’ve never had that many features on a project ever, than on More Perfect, and they all have a purpose and they all function together and they all function really fuckin’ tightly.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll:</strong> It’s like you’re more intentional with everything.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>Way more intentional.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>And it’s the same way I feel with my beats, too. I could spend a million hours making some weird sound patch and playing with it and making a synth line, but now I feel like I have more intentionality in my work.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>That’s all the fuck I think about for real, is the majority of this shit. The joke is that people never see me doing school work.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>You don’t!</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>Yet I’ve been on scholarship this whole fucking time, and I’m still here, Scott.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>But he’s in the journalism school, he can just write. He’s fine.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II:</strong> I’m still here, Scott. I’m still here, Scott. I’m in this bitch. We’re here, so...</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>Whereas I’m always doing school work.</p><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Who are some of the features on <em>More Perfect</em>?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://myrihab.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">MyrihaB</a>, Me eN You, Lord Of The Fly’s on there three times, because I was around him all summer—Lord Of The Fly. There’s a lot of women on here, a lot of women of color on this album, which I’m happy about. I’ve got hiwot, who previously went by Nesh, but she’s going by hit now. My homegirl&nbsp;Taylor Scott’s gonna be on that shit. My homie David Lopez I met in New York is on that shit. Cuevo. There’s a lot of shit I want to do section-wise.My friend who did the DJ Farrakhan voice will be on this motherfucker again. When we first did DJ Farrakhan, the guy who did that was like, “I don’t even want you to credit me, bro, because people take this shit the wrong way.”</p><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: And that’s a whole theme on the EP, that you’re saying these things but also wondering about how people might react to it and take things the wrong way. You’ve got a skit at the end where someone kills you for what you say on the EP, and for releasing it on MLK Day with that cover.</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>This next EP is going to be like Farrakhan but he didn’t kill me, so now the album’s gonna be about me building up the strength or courage to try and think about whether or not I’m going to kill him. It’s going to end up at the party for my death, and I’m going to try to come back and avenge my death, because he thought he killed me but he didn’t. So that’s what this whole album, narrative-wise, is going to go for. I can’t fucking wait. I really can’t wait. And going into the next year, our live show is going to be ridiculous.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll:</strong> This is something we’ve been talking about for so long. Michael’s biggest strength is performing live, and really putting a lot behind our live shows. It’s not just him going crazy and rapping his ass off, but there’s like a huge, nuts experience. Our live show’s good now, but we could totally push it to another level. As a DJ, I used to battle and scratch and do all this crazy stuff, and I can also play out live synths and drum machines and all that, and we’re really gonna come out with something nuts.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II:</strong> I love the theatrics. I love the cinematic part.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>We’ve been playing with that too, with lighting—</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>We’re going to think about lighting, props. Even the way I perform certain cues or certain things I’m trying to do with my voice, or the moments where I’m not saying anything and how to maximize that, the sort of shit I could say in between shit.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>And just thinking about the dynamic. As a DJ, I think about that all the time—how do I structure your set, how do I make your songs work together, so that we really have something that manipulates people’s energy and their moods so that we really give something, a moving performance.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>We transport them with us. They gotta take a ride with us, they’re gonna stand with us, it’s not gonna be one-sided. You’re not gonna just be sad and like, “Oh, why is he making me think about shit?” You’re not gonna be like, “OK, let’s turn up and that’s it.”</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>The performance aspect of it is gonna be so cool, because it doesn’t matter who you are, something about the performance is gonna pull you in.</p><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Another thing that’s real important, going back to the EP, is that you tend to go back and forth between being playful or and being serious or outraged, sometimes really suddenly. How did you develop your sense of humor and that balance of humor and seriousness?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>That’s me everyday. That’s some everyday shit. That’s how I live. The constant fluctuation of going from zero to 100 really fucking quick, Scott Gordon. That’s me every goddamn day. We talk about so much dumb shit, so much real shit.&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/crashprez" target="_blank">Look at my Twitter</a>—my Twitter is an extension of me too, like, I’ll be talking about the Shmigo tape and then 10 Tweets about how I think “black-on-black crime” is so fucking stupid and how it’s not a real term and people are stupid for using it, and then we’ll go right back to like, “Oh, well, Bobby Shmurda dropped a new song? Oh, I like it.” I’m all over the fucking place.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>Michael’s always bouncing off the walls, and with that comes humor. I feel like every way you kick it, it will just have the same humor. We’ll just clown on each other.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>It’s understood already. When people who don’t know me—</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>They feel intimidated. If it’s just you and me hanging out, and we’re just joking—</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>The entire room can come into it. Like Juiceboxxx, remember? When Juiceboxxx came, bro, we were like trolling him about Internet shit, but it was like a ping-pong match. There was like 10 other people watching us talk. Either people get intimidated or think I’m trying to talk shit on them or talk down on them, when in reality I’m just joking, but I can’t really joke with everybody—</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll:</strong> And sometimes that’s problematic for him. I’m gonna put that out there.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>I ain’t gonna put that on blast! We ain’t gonna talk about that. I’m an artist, I’m sensitive about my shit. Rappers are sensitive creatures.
Tone Madison: But like you are saying, there are lots of moments where people can’t quite tell if you’re trying to be funny or serious or what.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>That’s part of the fun, though. Interpreting where he’s at, seeing where he’s at with shit.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II:</strong> I just love to fuck with people in general, especially in the live show. Last week when we did a live show, I was like—</p><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Was this the Riff Raff show?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II:</strong> No, not even the Riff Raff show. I was tired and dehydrated during the Riff Raff show.</p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: I</strong> trolled so much.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II:</strong> You played “Hot Nigga”! I didn’t even want to go there! It was like, when he plays “Hot Nigga,” I have no choice but to be in the moment!&nbsp;</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1pHHclwCsZU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>When I DJ for his sets, I just play a really obnoxious hype DJ with a bunch of ridiculous drops. I used to have AIM sounds and shit and just like—he made tags for me that are hilarious,. I’d plug in my phone off Vine and just play Vines as a drop. It was stupid. But yeah, I do ridiculous shit, and people love it, and they think it’s funny and they get it, sort of.</p><p>
	<strong>Michael Penn II: </strong>But even if they don’t, they’re engaged by it. Last week, I was at Bright Red Studios and I did this show. And me and Dan freestyled and we fucked that shit up, right? Like “Woo, make some noise if you live right now! You know what, you could not be live but you exist! Make some noise if you exist!” And like a third of the people did anything. I’m like, “You don’t know one thing about it, do you?” And I just walked back in and waited for my set to start. I gotta take people on that ride with me or I feel like it’s not authentic. It would be inauthentic and not genuine of me to be completely one-sided.</p><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: What are your plans for Catch Wreck in 2015?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>Generally,more shows and more releases, but spending more time executing those in ways that challenge us as artists. For shows, really curating an experience. For releases,more collaboration. We’ve talked a bit about holding workshops of our own, like summer camp for artists. We’ve done it before on smaller scales, but really having an “art bootcamp.” Naturally, those things spark collaboration. We try as best as possible to get folks collaborating without forcing anything. Genre-wise, CW will always be eclectic. People in the collective will release whatever music they want as long as it's thought-out and well-developed. The beauty of the label is that people from different music spheres will share new ideas and perspectives. It helps to cultivate our growth as artists.</p><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: With a release like <em>Sleepers</em>, does that kind of come from everyone wanting an opportunity to experiment with a certain range of sounds?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong><em>Sleepers</em> was one of those projects that emerged out of appreciation for "ambient" music (It's a shitty label, LOL). For awhile, Jackson (Kiazma) and I were sharing a lot of textural music with each other. We talked about doing a split release of tracks in that vein back in early 2013, but it took awhile before I could really force Kiazma to release his tracks.</p><iframe src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1881012017/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1749726540/transparent=true/" seamless="">&amp;amp;amp;lt;a href="http://catchwreckcollective.bandcamp.com/album/sleepers"&amp;amp;amp;gt;Sleepers by *hitmayng&amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;gt;</iframe><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: And a lot (though not all) of the CW artists are from Madison. Do you feel it's important to create a bigger voice for these artists in the community?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Ian Carroll: </strong>Definitely! Madison has a ton of talented artists who feel disconnected from a “scene." I felt like it only made sense to unify so that people who were making music for themselves could have more opportunities to present their work to larger groups of people.</p>

      <p>
	To someone just diving in for the first time,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Burial-Hex/159520650742375" target="_blank">Burial Hex</a> would understandably seem pretty freewheeling and all over the place. Across 10 years and literally&nbsp;<a href="http://burialhex.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">dozens of releases</a>, the musical project has spanned blistering noise, choral and classical music, and a host of other inspirations ranging from electronic music to black metal, often cloaked in elements of occult spirituality and other esoteric themes. More often than not, all those disparate influences cohere in unlikely and beautiful forms.</p><p>
	But to Clay Ruby, the Madison-based musician behind the project, Burial Hex has always been a finite project with a beginning, middle, and end, albeit with a great deal of sonic freedom. The end gets a little closer with next week's release of his new album&nbsp;<a href="http://handmadebirds.com/artistsburialhex.html" target="_blank"><em>The Hierophant</em></a>, on the Handmade Birds label. (A triple LP called <em>Final Mysteries</em>, still in the works, will be the official final Burial Hex release.)</p><p>
	Even at this late stage, Burial Hex is still morphing and occasionally shedding old habits: <em>The Hierophant</em> begins with the melodic baritone crooning of "Winter Dawn," and the album mostly leaves behind the guttural death-growls and screamed vocals that have figure into many BH releases. The album features contributions from several musicians Ruby has befriended in Madison over the years, including Nate Ritter, Troy Schafer, and Kathleen Baird. It also benefits from more far-flung collaborations: The San Francisco-based Edmund Xavier, who plays with Ruby  and German musician Bunker Wolf in the group&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/BLADESSPORTSMAN" target="_blank">Horrid Red</a>, played on the record, and UK techno producer Perc remixed one Hierophant track, "Final Love."</p><p>
	Ruby's other projects over the years have included the more metal-centered Wormsblood and the Madison-based improvisational collective Second Family Band, and the&nbsp;<a href="http://bravemysteries.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Brave Mysteries</a> label, which he runs&nbsp;with Ritter,&nbsp;but for now he's not saying much about what he'll do after he puts Burial Hex to rest. Clay spoke with me recently about the scope of the project and making <em>The Hierophant</em>.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: You've always talked about Burial Hex as a finite project. Why?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Clay Ruby:</strong> Two reasons. First is that I wanted it to seem like more than just a noise project. I didn't want to just be making noise, which could go on forever and have no direction at all. I was treating it more like a composition cycle that an organ composer or even a symphonic composer would use. I wanted to do a take on that so that it would seem like it had a purpose, and a beginning and an ending. And when I started it, I knew I wasn't still going to want to make that music 10 years from then or whatever. I wanted to be able to say, "This is a project that I'm doing. It's not me." I think it's easy to say, "Merzbow is Merzbow," or whatever, instead of "It's this Akita guy who does this project." It's too easy to associate his art with him, and I don't want that to happen as easily with my stuff.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: When you started doing Burial Hex, was there an element of challenging yourself to do certain things?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Clay Ruby: </strong>Yeah, I was really into Maurizio Bianchi at the time. I was just starting to get into power electronics, especially Italian power electronics,which, unlike British stuff where it's a really annoying noise and some offensive lyrics, a lot of the Italian stuff is a half-hour piece of grey noise and you don't really understand what that has to do with the gore that's on the album cover or whatever they're trying to portray. So I felt like they were somehow taking something really abstract and putting a lot of intent and meaning into it, and that was a big challenge: How can I take this sound that might mean absolutely nothing to the listener and infuse it with something that means a lot to me?</p><p>
	The other big challenge was that before that, any time I ever did any kind of experimental music, it's like your sound is whatever the instrument sounds like, and I just had no interest in sounding like a bunch of effects that I bought. I wanted to come up with sounds that I could think of—"I want to make a sound that makes me feel like this, or sounds like this" and then actually set out to do that as a sound designer, as opposed to just being like, "Oh, my phase pedal's making my distortion pedal sound like this or that."</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: It's a finite project but it's also really sprawling.</strong></p><p><strong>
	Clay Ruby:</strong> I had specific albums that I definitely wanted to do, but in order to do them I had to do a ton of screwing around and composing and experimenting. So that's where all the tapes and everything come from. One problem with the discography is things came out in a really random order. Some guy asked me for a tape, and it would take him two years to put it out, meanwhile the album that that tape was an experiment leading up towards had already come out. I don't have it listed in any kind of chronological order in the discography even. I don't even remember exactly what order everything happened in. It is really confusing, but a lot of times if a piece ended up on a CD-R or something, it was something I was doing to prepare, or something that I thought was going to be part of an album, but it led to other thoughts and ended up changing over time.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: Over time it's touched on many different sounds and genres. Did you see this as a project where you'd have the space to try lots of things, or is there something central tying it all together?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Clay Ruby:</strong> I always felt like there was a structure tying it together, but I understand that it's personal enough that it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The first time that I ever introduce what you'd call metal vocals into the project was the first track on <em>Initiations</em> where i was doing the real guttural vocals, but I was listening to a lot of choral music at the time and I was trying to imagine bass singers, and if you applied extended technique to that and turned it really low, as a whole register below bass, but in a classical context—so I had the strings going on the first track of Initiations, and then the low guttural vocals, I kind of saw it as the bass part in Beethoven's Ninth where this voice comes through the symphony for the first time. But that was my own personal thing and I never wanted that to be forced upon the listener. I don't expect the listener to get that in order to appreciate the piece.</p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3065881258/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=808773660/transparent=true/" seamless="">
&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href="http://burialhex.bandcamp.com/album/initiations"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;INITIATIONS by Burial Hex&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
</iframe><p>
	<br>I felt completely free to do anything with the project. The only rule was to be honest with myself about following up on little weird ideas like that. I'd get an idea like that and start working on it and think, "This is never going to work." And this is where some of the tapes come up because I'd make stuff trying to work towards this idea I had and it wouldn't always work out, but it would still be interesting enough to let people hear. But as long as I was working towards trying to accomplish whatever oddball thing I was focusing on, that was the rule, basically.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: <em>The Hierophant</em> at times recalls a lot of the different phases of Burial Hex. Was that deliberate?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Clay Ruby:</strong> No, not really. It just was another natural process. It seems like every album, I'll figure out some new stuff that I want to draw in, and it's important to keep everything the past still active, anything that still seems relevant, at least. These things just keep falling in there. I'll still be interested in some strange sound, it'll still remind me of something meaningful, but at the same time I'll be working with Troy on some string piece and I'll think, "Well, why can't they both be in the same piece?" So I didn't set out to make it eclectic. It's just important to me to not let go of old things while still introducing new things.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: Were there any specific themes you wanted to explore on this album?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Clay Ruby: </strong>Part of it was that I kind of had joked to Troy that I wanted to make an EP of love songs for Handmade Birds specifically, and that it was going to be called <em>The Hierophant</em>. That was just some spitballing tirade between he and I, and he said, "Sure, let's do it." I kind of just put the idea aside, and then one day I was talking to the Handmade Birds guy and said, "You should do this album for me," and he said, "Oh, I'd love to." Then all of a sudden I was like, "Oh, shit, now we've gotta make an album." But everything fell into place exactly as it should. All the themes were already in place. I wanted to try and make at least one album that dealt with concepts of earthly love, because I hadn't really dealt with that, but I think that earthly relationships are a huge source of pain and sometimes you might be having some huge existential problem and not realize that it's coming from some interaction you had with your mom that morning or your girlfriend or something like that. I wanted to be able to look at those parts of my life and see if any of them connected with the overall Burial Hex theme, and I found a bunch of it did, actually.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: Is there any element of sadness in finishing the project, or that you'll miss working on it?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Clay Ruby: </strong>No, not at all. I'm totally happy with it being over. It's a big part of growing up for me, doing this project. I don't want to talk about my private life or my past too much, but there are times when I'll be working on something, and then remember some theme from two albums ago and then realize what that was about and then not even understand that I was expressing this thing from age 5 or something. I really do feel completely foreign to about the first two-thirds of the project at this point. I wouldn't go back and do it now. I don't really enjoy violent sounds anymore. I don't really enjoy screaming anymore. There are just things about the project that I don't feel the need to do anymore. I do think they're effective, and when I try to listen to that music objectively, I think, "Oh, shit, this is exactly what I was trying to do at the time." I definitely don't feel the need to jump in the crowd and hit people and throw things at people or scream in people's faces or light things on fire quite as much as I used to.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: On <em>The Hierophant</em>, were there any particular songs or moments that you found particularly challenging, or that were a creative stretch for you?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Clay Ruby:</strong> It was really rewarding to finish "Final Love." It's one of those songs where I completely thought of the whole thing beforehand, and then got really bummed out, because I thought, "How in the hell am I going to make that?" And it turned out exactly as I'd thought, and I am really proud of it. I feel like it's the last big screaming song that I'm ever going to do, and I know some people are attached to that voice, so it was kind of trying to give them one last little thing.</p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/172212342&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false">
</iframe><p>
	<br><strong>Tone Madison: Right, you're really sparing with the screaming and more focused on melodic vocals on this record.</strong></p><p><strong>
	Clay Ruby:</strong> I don't have a particularly good ear when it comes to pitch, so even trying to get clean or melodic vocals down was a big challenge as well. But I wanted everyone to hear a naked voice, which is something I've been dealing with since <em>In Psychic Defense</em>. I really like the idea of just walking up to the mic without any effects on it, and then sing into the mic and just deal with it and see what it sounds like. It's a surprise to me, and it's a surprise to the listener.</p><p>
	The last song, "The Most Foolish Son Is Always The Oldest One," is another one where I pictured it from beginning to end and then had no idea how it was going to get pulled off. I remember emailing Nate Ritter about it, trying to describe it to him, and he just said, "Yeah, that's not gonna happen."</p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/159890754&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false">
</iframe><p>
	<br><strong>Tone Madison: What about it made him say that?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Clay Ruby: </strong>I was describing sort of a footwork kick with a Fela Kuti keyboard part and Morricone-type horns and all these different things and too many weird combinations that didn't make sense to me even, really, but it was important to at least try it.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: What interests you about having people remix your songs?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Clay Ruby:</strong> For bigger releases like this, it's a celebratory thing. For <em>Book Of Delusions</em>, it felt like such a landmark that I wanted to do an extra bonus remix thing, and for this one it was kind of the same thing, where I knew there were going to be these staggered premieres when it came out, so I thought it would be nice to do celebratory remixes with friends of mine, just to give a little extra to the listener. But I'm always nervous doing that, and I've gotten back some remixes that I'll just go, "Well, this is not interesting," and I don't do anything with those. The Perc one was really weird because he had used every element of the song that I didn't use in my remixes. It was the same thing with the Circulation Of Light remix of the title track—he just basically used the opposite of what I used for my own remix.</p><p><strong>
	Tone Madison: How did the Perc remix come about?</strong></p><p><strong>
	Clay Ruby: </strong>I just know him from doing the&nbsp;<a href="http://perctrax.bandcamp.com/album/feral-grind" target="_blank"><em>Feral Grind </em>compilation</a> on his label, and this is something I do with all the artists on Brave Mysteries too, where if there's something that's bugging me about it, then I send it back and tell him what I think. It's always led to something really interesting and amazing, so I've learned to not be scared to do that. With Perc it was a little weird because we're just from totally different worlds. But it's funny because my remix of that song is a hard, distorted, post-techno remix like what his last album was, and then his remix was probably what he thought a power-electronics or noise piece was going to be like. But he did things that evoked a few influences that I thought were really interesting, so I just kept kind of giving him pointers and ideas and after a few revisions it turned into something really unique.</p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/171118067&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false">

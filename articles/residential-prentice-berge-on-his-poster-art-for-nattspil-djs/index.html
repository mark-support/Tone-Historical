      <p>
	Welcome to Residential, where 
	<em>Tone Madison</em> meets the best acts holding down regular gigs on local stages and decks, from sturdy weeknight house bands to excellent and under-appreciated DJs. This time we take a bit of a detour to ask Madison restaurateur Prentice Berge about the poster art he creates for the DJs who spin <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=s7nckhbe34gbqr0avsshu9mcmg@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Chicago" target="_blank">seven nights a week</a> from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Nattspiel" target="_blank">Nattspil</a> on King Street.
</p>
<p>
	On the surface Berge's posters, which you'll likely only see if you follow the Nattspil Facebook page or are Facebook friends with someone who DJs there, run flagrantly counter to the low-key, minimalist aesthetic Berge has cultivated at Nattspil itself. Berge, who also books the DJs, is a self-taught Photoshopper run amok, exuberantly appropriating images ranging from retro computer ads to the cover of Jethro Tull's 
	<em>Thick As A Brick</em> and frequently finding silly ways to incorporate his DJs' faces and names into bizarre contexts. Nattspil could get away with presenting its DJ lineup a bit more self-seriously—regulars like Nick Nice, Phil Money, Lauren Franchi, Vilas Park Sniper, and DJ Zukas are adept at digging deep into their musical knowledge to sculpt the mood of the place, and in a given week the sounds can span from house to disco to hip-hop to far-out psych experiments—so it's admirable that Berge takes a more playful, at times in-joke-y approach. Berge, who also designs posters for the other musical endeavors he's involved in around town (including Hoot 'N Annie and the Madison Song Circle) talked with me recently about finding inspiration for his posters on the Internet and from the DJs themselves.

	<strong><em data-redactor-tag="em"></em>Tone Madison: Do you have a favorite person to do posters for?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Prentice Berge: </strong>When it comes to the DJs, like with all art, the more personal connections you have, the more you know someone, the more you can play with ideas. I've got DJs like Nick Nice that have been there since day one. He's a great day and a Madison institution. Vilas Park Sniper. Those are people that I've known for a long time and I know their personalities, and I know people like DJ Trichrome, and I know Nathan Johnson Zukas really, really well. We're buddies. I know here I can push buttons or be absurd—utterly absurd. For instance, DJ Trichrome, there's this one where I take his little head logo and stick it on a Dolly Madison cakes thing, and it's a Victorian woman and lace and things like that. I can put him on a female body or a very skinny male at the back of a swimming pool with five Barbies sitting on the side of it and have fun.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: You do seem to have a lot of fun with Zukas in particular, just doing stuff with Nathan's face and whatnot. How much of that is a product of you knowing him?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Prentice Berge:</strong> I know him really well and it's disco, and disco as a musical form is meant—I mean, think about the clothing, the men and women, it was all about pushing identity and boundaries, the silk shirts and the rayon shirts open to the belly button and stuff like that. I've got Amos Smith, who's a house DJ, and looking for underground homes and caverns and underwater homes and Edward Scissorhands-type communities to plug his name and face into is really fun. I really love old albums, especially '40s, '50s, '60s, '70s. There's some really funny art that's that there that I don't really have to do all that much with. I just steal it. Truth be told, if Harry Fox went after me like he goes after me in music, I'd be out of business, because I borrow every single day. Every single piece is something that I found on the internet. Well, that's not absolutely true. Some of them come from constructions that I do myself, but it's all montage, and montage means that you're begging, borrowing, and stealing all over the place.
</p>

Tone Madison: Do the DJs ever suggest things to you, or is this just all at your whim?<br>
<br>
</strong><strong>Prentice Berge: </strong>More often, I get something like “I really like that one, can we do more in that style?" I try not to repeat myself at all. Finding cool and interesting images is really a strange path. Just coming up with search queries, combinations of words, words like “absurd" or “mentality" or “disco"—some things that you would think are obvious, a word like “disco," absolutely useless. It just gives you images that are just burnt up already, they're used. You really have to find words in torrid combinations and things like that.<br>
<br>
And back to your question about whether you know somebody—well, I know who likes this this and this, what happens when you throw those three words into a search query? Or what happens when you mix those words up? With three words you can do it, what, nine different ways? Help me with my math. And it makes a difference. I think a lot of people, when they do searches on the Internet, they're looking for web answers, or word answers, they're not looking for image answers. I'm in the realm of images, and by doing that search, so far, it's been fresh. I don't know how long that will last. There are some fabulous artists out there that just absolutely put me to shame doing the same kind of thing. If I'm going blind with a DJ or they have a buddy showing up, those are the absolute hardest ones to do, because I have no connection, and I don't know if putting a little bear face on somebody is going to work or not, or whether it's gonna work with their friends. These posters, probably 150 people see these. Its really a small core group. It's hyper-contextualized, but the reason why I did it, it wasn't advertising, it was to fire up the DJs. As a musician, to spend your life playing and getting almost absolutely no press or recognition, and it's a lot of work to make posters—it moves them in the realm of, “I'm a real pro. I've got posters made about me." I remember when our group the Learning Curve and Solidarity Singalong got to share a poster with Jackson fucking Browne and Tom Morello at a labor protest. Everybody in the band that had never had that happen before, it was like the biggest thing that had ever happened in their lives.
<p>
	<br>
	In terms of bottom-line sales, it's had an impact, certainly we're doing a little bit more numbers since I started doing it. Whether that was me or something completely random that had nothing to do with me at all, I don't know. But I want my DJs to feel special. I want them to come to have fun. Nattspil, since day one, 11 years ago, we've had a DJ every single night since we opened. Well, we've had somebody blow off a night once or twice, but in 11 years, nobody else is doing that. Some places are starting to do four nights a week or something like that. The Inferno does quite a few nights, Maduro does quite a few nights, but we do every single night. We've always said, “You can play whatever you fuckin' want, but do make people happy. Be happy, have fun." They can do whatever they want and have fun, and new DJs can get their feet wet and feel included.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: Have you ever had something really backfire on you, where the artist really didn't like your poster or wasn't comfortable with what you did?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Prentice Berge:</strong> Once. It was a situation where he had said, “I've got an old-school DJ in town," who I didn't know, “and he's gonna be part of the bill." And I created something for both of them and he's like, “Can you do something more like you did other times?" I just went and made another one. I liked the one that I did, and I had spent a lot of time on it. I was a little pissy at first. I said, “Well, I spent two hours making this, but if you really want…" And he backed up and said, “No no, we can go with it," but I said, “no, that's fine." I vet them through the DJs before they ever go public. They get to see it beforehand.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: Are there any recently that you've been particularly proud of?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Prentice Berge: </strong>Oh, I'm kind of proud of all of them. I mean, they're my children. I'm proud of them all. It's just like my menus. My menus don't get printed unless—I've got a personal stamp which is the Nattspil stamp that goes on every menu, and I personally hand-stamp every single one. It's my name, it's my place, it's my art. If I don't like it, I'm not gonna put it out in the first place. There's a lot of stuff that never makes it live. I'll work on something for four hours and just throw it away because I just don't like it—the idea that started it became muddled. It's like a music mix that just get too many voices and parts and cooks in the kitchen, or I thought these two ideas would match or it just ends up forced or artificial. I put out 11 posters a week between my bands and the DJs, and at some point I need to say, “I need some me time." I've got a lot of irons in the fire.

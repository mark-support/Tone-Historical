      <p>
	<a href="http://www.christinestyle.com/" target="_blank">Christine Style</a>'s recently opened show at the James Watrous Gallery,<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="http://www.wisconsinacademy.org/gallery/randall-berndt-taming-nature-christine-style-visual-stories-and-genetic-explosions" target="_blank"><em>Visual Stories And Genetic Explosions</em></a>, spans from the playful to the somber. Throughout the exhibit, the Green Bay-based artist and UW-Green Bay professor uses strange and whimsical hybridizations and interactions of different kinds of creatures. One group of prints, <em>Genetic Explosions</em>, swirls a multitude of animal forms and parts thereof into wildly textured, multicolored, semi-formless arrays that just might be new creatures themselves&mdash;in a couple of them, the resulting multi-species jumble has a pair of legs sticking out of it, punctuating the chaos with a suggestion of cohesion. One <em>Genetic Explosions</em> work comprises a bunch of more defined, yet decidedly cartoonish, imaginary beasties spread across a reproduction of a blueprint.
</p>
<p>
	The other main group of works in the show, a woodblock print series called <em>Stories Of The Heart</em>, is a series of stately portraits that use the imagery of the heart to explore different facets of the human character. Style dedicated these to her late husband, Tony Rajer, an art conservator who died of a heart attack in 2011, when she was just getting started on the series. In something of a tribute to and a play on Rajer's legacy, Style also has&nbsp;<a href="http://wisconsinvisualartists.com/album995/Style-3ScreenprintsWithMold2-14.jpg" target="_blank">three prints here to which she applied mold</a>&mdash;the kind of stuff Rajer was usually trying to protect old works of art against&mdash;inviting the microbes into her printmaking process by applying yogurt, cheese, and sugar to the works. Style discussed her work with us before last week's opening celebration for the exhibit, which runs through December 23 in tandem with a show by fellow Wisconsin artist Randall Berndt.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: How did the <em>Stories Of The Heart</em> series originate?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Christine Style:</strong> The first one was a giant heart, and it was for a juried exhibit that was in collaboration with the Bellin Heart and Vascular Center in Green Bay. My late husband always had things with his heart, so it got to be, "What is the heart?" <em>Holy Heart</em> was the third in the series, and the previous two were more about interiors, so you had the interior of the body, like medical illustrations, but it changed to include references to Hindi art and Hanuman, the monkey god.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: One thread that runs through this whole exhibit is hybridized animal and human figures of all sorts. What draws you to that?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Christine Style:</strong> Just kind of inventing. <em>Warrior Heart</em> is about taking charge, that if you want something you have to fight for it. It doesn't have to be a beast, but it could be anything, but just taking charge. My husband died when I was in the middle of carving that one, so everything just kind of sat for a year and a half. The rest came after that. This one was right before that one, and it was after my eye surgery and getting two new eyes, and just the fear of being a visual artist and all of a sudden you're getting two new eyes, and what if something happens? They cut into your eye. Before, I could never see far, and would be able to see very close without any glasses, and after the surgery I can see fine far, but I can't see close. I wasn't expecting that kind of change, but I'm happy that I'm seeing. In the Buddhist culture there's these&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thangka#Gallery" target="_blank">thangkas with the figures</a>, and there are figures inside the body for different body points, so I'm just kind of playing with that.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: So this body of work was really informed by two events that were very different but obviously both traumatic. </strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Christine Style: </strong>My husband always had problems with his heart, and after reading his journals, after he died, [I realized] he was thinking about it much more than he ever let on. He was able to see some of these. The first one I did after he died was <em>Benevolent Heart 1</em>, and I guess I'm thinking about nurturing and teaching and taking care of, and he was an art conservator and all of a sudden I was taking care of his entire archive, which has now all been donated to the state historical society, which I'm very happy about.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Where did he work as a conservator?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Christine Style: </strong>He was in Madison and in Green Bay. He worked at the state capitol for five years, in charge of the restoration and re-gilding of the lady on the dome. He was a private, independent conservator, so he did work for the Chazen and different museums. He did a lot of WPA post-office murals. Post offices are changing a lot around the country, so they're trying to figure out what to do with these murals, and he would come in and try to find homes for them and restore them. He was very much a proponent of heritage&mdash;if we don't take care of it, who will?
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: So to what extent was this work informed by the grieving process?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Christine Style: </strong>I don't know. They were me continuing, more than anything, and continuing to have my voice, and I knew that's what he would want. <em>Benevolent Heart II</em>, things aren't quite in sync. The cat is thinking about the bird and she's thinking about the heart, the sacred heart, in a different way, so it's not always in sync. <em>Empathetic Heart</em> is in some way a play off the same thing&mdash;she's thinking about feeding and taking care of the rat, where the rat is much more interested in this math problem. It's a humorous play on the idea that you don't know what people are thinking. Sometimes empathy isn't always connected with something.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Did you go into the mold experiment with an idea of how the results would look?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Christine Style: </strong>I had no idea. I thought the organic matter would be attracted to the pink, that's the yogurt, and I thought it would be attracted to that, but mold just kind of explodes all over, and blooms and goes where it wants to. For [the three prints that use mold], the ink was flour, sugar, yogurt, aged cheese, a little water, a little ink color, and I thought the mold would be attracted to this organic matter, but instead it sort of bloomed and blossomed and went anywhere it wanted. So that brought up the whole idea of explosions. I was fascinated with Tony's archive again, because I kept finding pictures with mold and mildew, things that he would continually repair and remove.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: So you took something that's usually destructive to artwork and wanted to see what it could add.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Christine Style: </strong>Yeah&mdash;if you ignore it, something will happen. Once they're out of the moist environment, they kind of stop and just are frozen there, and that's how most people find it, either in basements or in floods and things getting wet. They dry them and they kind of still have the stuff, but it's not really growing anymore.
</p>
<p>
	My mantra for myself has been "keep it simple and have fun." And sometimes my simple is not simple for others, but having fun was a big part of it&mdash;the spontaneity, letting something go. I can do a lot of things, but I just wanted to have something come out and see what would happen if I had somewhat of a direction and a process, but just had fun with the process. So the ink drawings are a process. There's two plates here done with ink, sometimes toner wash and floor polish and rubbing alcohol and other things. I didn't want to fill the page. I wanted them to be kind of standalone beings. Sometimes they have feet, as if they're walking away.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: In creating this group of works, was there anything that you were trying to challenge yourself to do?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Christine Style:</strong> Because I love process, the print just seemed the perfect process for these, because you can really explore with color, ink the color plate with a different color and pair it with the key plate. There's a lot of exploration. I don't really use the print to make a lot of multiples of the exact same thing. Even with the woodcuts, if I do an edition it's only of 10 or so, because I'm more interested in what's going to happen next.

	<strong>THURSDAY JANUARY 22</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.madisoncomedy.com/comicbio.php?name=Moshe+Kasher" target="_blank">Moshe Kasher. Comedy Club On State, through Jan. 24, see link for showtimes.</a>
</p>
<p>
	When he played the Comedy Club On State a year ago, stand-up Moshe Kasher's act was every bit as arch and nerdy and playfully offensive as you'd expect it to be from his 2013 special <em>Live In Oakland</em>—but also more approachable and conversational, and come to think of it even a bit funnier, than that special lets on. Kasher gets a lot of mileage out of his own admittedly goofy looks and being Jewish, but also finds a graceful way through bits about such convoluted subject matter as the history of Jim Morrison's grave.<br>

</p>
<p>
	The best argument for attending this panel on the intersection of arts and entrepreneurship in Madison is the collective experience of the speakers. City of Madison arts administrator Karin Wolf will be giving a keynote talk on how the arts generate economic activity in Dane County. After that, there will be a panel discussion with participants including Paula Panczenko, director of of UW-Madison's Tandem Press, and Ben Reiser, a coordinator for the Wisconsin Film Festival and UW-Cinematheque. With those folks alone representing some interesting city arts-grant programs, a compelling printmaking organization, and a successful film festival, this might end up being a pretty substantive discussion.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>FRIDAY JANUARY 23</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/810916285648145/" target="_blank">Nineteen Thirteen. Frequency, 9 p.m.</a>
</p>
<p>
	While no one will likely pass up mentioning the presence of ex-Violent Femmes drummer Victor DeLorenzo in the cello-powered post-rock band Nineteen Thirteen, they probably shouldn't forget all the other reasons to indulge the Milwaukee trio. For instance, all the gorgeous weeping cello arrangements and tastefully layered, shuffling percussion that haunt 2013's <em>Mr. Panicker</em> EP or its jazzy looseness, organic feel, and refreshing avoidance of the genre's admittedly cheap (but still often enjoyable) cascading dynamics.

	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/993529243997337/" target="_blank">Waka Flocka Flame, *hitmayng, M-Nat, Lil Rail. Majestic, 9 p.m.</a>
</p>
<p>
	Alright, we're still a little bummed about our last encounter with Atlanta rapper and former member of Gucci Mane's Bricksquad crew Waka Flocka Flame, when he played 2014's Revelry festival on campus. During his set he basically played hype-man to his backing tracks and danced around the stage to his own music, barely rapping in that monstrous and commanding voice we all fell for on punishing tracks like “G Check" and “Hard In Da Paint." But to be fair, it was also part of a college-party atmosphere loaded with screaming fratboys and underaged kids, so that probably didn't help matters. We also weren't all that stoked on his new flirtations with post-Diplo, radio EDM and it's hard to say what that means for upcoming album <em>Flockavelli 2</em>, which is supposedly coming out sometime this year. But whatever, it's Waka, and in Madison we don't get a ton of hip-hop shows on this scale, so it might be worth checking it out in a more appropriate environment and giving his live show another shot—especially with an opening set from versatile and prolific Madison producer *hitmayng on the bill.

</p>
<p>
	UW-Cinematheque's spring season kicks off with this new documentary about Japanese filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki and his home base, Studio Ghibli. Ctek will be following it up on Saturday with what is supposed to be Miyazaki's final film, <em>The Wind Rises</em>. For a more detailed review of the documentary and further thoughts on Ghibli, <a href="http://www.tonemadison.com/articles/studio-ghiblis-vast-window-of-discovery" target="_blank">read our guy Chris Lay's excellent piece on Ghibli</a> from earlier this week.<br>

</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/590679384411420" target="_blank">Exile on Willy St. High Noon Saloon, 9 p.m.</a>
</p>
<p>
	A cast of at least two dozen musicians, most of them from Madison—including Whitney Mann, Dietrich Gosser, Meghan Rose, Nick Brown, and organizer Matt Earley—will join forces at this show to cover the Rolling Stones' <em>Exile On Main St.</em> album in its entirety. We'll have a slightly more detailed preview of the show later this week, but it's anyone's guess how all the different performers will interpret such an intimidating batch of great songs.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	We were sad to see Madison punk sweethearts Bes Monde hang it up last year, but one member, Eric Schinker, has formed the new trio Uzi Ferrari, which gets its debut here. Heading up the bill are solid Madison noise-rockers Sinking Suns, whose 2014 EP <em>Songs Of Revenge</em> made our <a href="http://www.tonemadison.com/articles/tone-madisons-top-20-madison-records-of-2014/" target="_blank">local-best-of-list</a> last year, as did Bes Monde's first and last album, <em>Party Cut</em>.<br>

</p>
<p>
	Twin Cities rapper/producer/beatboxer Terrell Woods, aka Carnage The Executioner, is a lot more gritty and confrontational than the hip hop artists most people associate with his hometown. But if he's a bit overshadowed, it's not for lack of skill—listening to his 2012 album <em>Respect The Name</em>, it's undeniable that the veteran MC has cultivated a nimble, sharp, often taunting style.<br>

</p>
<p>
	Leave it to the folks at Cinematheque to leave a certain Tone writer kicking himself in the ass for being away for the month of February. Look, there's little we can say about Orson Welles' near-unanimously heralded 1941 masterpiece, which encompasses the life of a newspaper baron loosely based on William Randolph Hearst. What we can say is that this is going to be an awesome opportunity to catch a gorgeous 35mm print of the best films ever and, similar to last year's incredible Hitchcock series, you'll be able to keep enjoying a variety of rare Welles prints through the end of February, with more Welles-themed screenings to come at this year's Wisconsin Film Festivals.<br>

<p>
	<a href="http://www.madisonorpheum.com/event/lewis-black" target="_blank">Lewis Black. Orpheum, 8 p.m.</a>
</p>
<p>
	There's more to Lewis Black than the mini-explosions of defeated rage that dot his bitterly funny stand-up sets, but the message always seems to be: This is what life does to someone who tries to insist on being rational. You could see Black's bits about politics and current affairs getting a bit played-out, but luckily for him, there are always new ways for things to get fucked up.<br>
</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/764395380306080" target="_blank">Active Percussion Duo. Mother Fool's, 8 p.m.</a>
</p>
<p>
	Between them, drummers Michael Brenneis and Geoff Brady have created an incredible amount to jazz and experimental music in town. Brenneis plays in the Tuesday <a href="http://www.tonemadison.com/articles/residential-the-new-breed-jazz-jam/" target="_blank">New Breed Jazz Jam</a> at the Cardinal, among other things, and Brady's work has included playing in klezmer ensemble Yid Vicious, the Madison Symphony Orchestra, and the short-lived but awesome experimental jazz trio <a href="https://mineallminerecords.bandcamp.com/album/monolithic" target="_blank">Glacier</a> (RIP), and the two used to play in an experimental group called Michael Brenneis' Tomato Box. Things get pretty wide open when they play together as the Active Percussion Duo—the instrumentation can span from marimbas and actual drums to household objects and all manner of makeshift noisemakers. Their 2001 album <a href="https://theactivepercussionduo.bandcamp.com/album/activity-for-the-active" target="_blank"><em>Activity For The Active</em></a> might give you some idea of what to expect—sometimes heavily deconstructed and sometimes flirting with the pleasantly cohesive.<br>

</p>
<p>
	As a speaker, author and host of the beautifully revamped <em>Cosmos</em> series, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has gone beyond just making science accessible and fun, and instead become the kind of pugnacious, unapologetic advocate that rational inquiry in an age where climate-change deniers and science-deniers only seem to be getting louder and crazier. His talk in Madison is sold out, but for what it's worth he'll be back in April for an <a href="http://www.nelson.wisc.edu/events/earth-day/" target="_blank">Earth Day Conference at Monona Terrace</a>.

	Madison comedian Toler Wolfe hosts a night of stand-up by fellow Madisonians Gena Gephart and Niamh O'Neill Culhane and Milwaukee comics Liz Ziner and Allison Dunne.

	To celebrate his birthday this year, longtime Madison throat-singer and all-around experimental-music collaborative butterfly DB Pedersen has put together a bunch of different performances. In a couple short hours he'll be sharing the stage with dance artists, distinguished players including Biff Blumfumgagnge, and less-distinguished musicians including Tone's own Scott Gordon.

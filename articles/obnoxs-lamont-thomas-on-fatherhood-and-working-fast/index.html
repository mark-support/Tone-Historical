	Under the name 
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LamontBimThomas" target="_blank">Obnox</a>, Cleveland's Lamont Thomas is quickly building one of the most compelling bodies of work in contemporary punk rock. A veteran of his hometown music scene (having played in bands including Bassholes, Deathers, Puffy Areolas, and This Moment in Black History), Thomas is a bit older than most of the people driving the fertile garage-punk explosion. But he's one of its most enthusiastic participants, even as he enters his early 40s and devotes much of his life to being a stay-at-home dad for his young daughter.

	Since 2011, Obnox has put out four full-length albums, and a dozen-odd EPs and 7-inches, that smear together grimy, melodic punk with production and rhythmic influences from hip hop and R&amp;B. In all that quantity there's also restless variety: On “Cynthia Piper At The Gates Of Dawn," from this year's excellent album 
	<em>Boogalou Reed</em>, Smith pulls out clanging, stomping psych-rock riffs; “Sit Yo Ass Down," from 2014's <a href="https://chunklet.bandcamp.com/album/the-juke-that-sat-by-the-door" target="_blank"><em>The Juke That Sat By The Door</em> EP</a>, harnesses slow-building, steamy funk; “Molecule," from the 2014 album <em>Louder Space</em>, lurches along to a mutated hip-hop rhythm. Ahead of Obnox's show <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/350496038469881" target="_blank">this Saturday at the Crystal Corner Bar</a>,Thomas talked with us about <em>Boogalou Reed</em>, the role of black artists in punk rock, and how fatherhood forces him to not suck.

	<strong>Tone Madison: You've mentioned that you like to work quickly on your recordings. How does that impact the way that you incorporate new ideas into your music?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Lamont Thomas: </strong>Sometimes they come out of thin air. A lot of songs, the lyrics are written in 10, 15 minutes, sometimes in the studio. Just once the juices get going, we don't waste time or money. If you got a good idea, strike while the iron's hot. A lot of things that I would consider a shortcoming for a band, like thinking too much about what a song needs, spending too much time mixing, and these types of things, bands have broken up for these types of reasons. I work alone and I don't have to answer to anybody, so that decreases a lot of the time spent deciding and getting everybody walking in the same direction. I don't think any of my records have taken more than a week to make.

	<strong>Tone Madison: What were some of the ideas you wanted to experiment with on <em data-redactor-tag="em">Boogalou Reed</em>?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Lamont Thomas:</strong> Well, <em>Boogalou Reed</em>, I was planning on recording that a few months after I actually recorded it, but my favorite engineer was moving to Texas, so I took every song I had and every skeleton I had at the time, just any rough idea, and took it down there. I start with the drums and just imagine what the song is, listen to the beats a couple times through, and I start putting down guitars. If I have a complete song, that's what I'm recording. If I have a sketch of an idea, I record that too. Sometimes I take it home at night and come back to the studio next day with lyrics or I write something in the morning. You know, it's when the spirit moves me, man. If I'm recording, everything's cooking, my mind is racing. I can't explain it. [Laughs.] It's fun just creating it, and I know I only have a certain amount of money and a certain amount of time, so I get everything I can done as quickly as possible. I don't agonize over any ideas. If it feels good, it probably sounds good—that's my premise, that's what I go on. Feel me. If I feel the lyric is maybe too profane… use it! You know what I mean? Rock 'n' roll and the rebel edge. I try not to think about the stuff that hinders most people.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: So you really force yourself to not second-guess things. </strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Lamont Thomas:</strong> I don't second-guess much. There's outtakes of things that I shove aside that don't fit in with the package or whatever, but at this point, I ain't got much time left. I'm just trying to do as good of records as I can and have some fun. First and foremost, let's have some fun.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Were there any songs on this record that you found to be particularly challenging or rewarding to make?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Lamont Thomas: </strong>I guess it's not a struggle. It's a joy, it's a pleasure. It's not a challenge. I love this shit. So, if there was somebody with enough time and tape right now, hell yeah, I got two songs and I ain't gotta pick my kid up until 3. I wish I had more money so that I could concentrate on recording and writing and know that my family's doing OK. That's the struggle, to make enough money to function and have enough time in the studio. A lot of bands just can't afford to be in the studio as long as they need, so I've figured out a way where I can do things in less than a week and get entire albums out of the deal. I love it.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: What were some of the stories you were trying to tell on this album?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Lamont Thomas: </strong>“Too Punk Shakur," a wild night in Cleveland, you pick up a woman, she informs you she's a hooker, next thing you know you ditch her and you run into some other girl, you hit the dance floor with her, she gives you some head. I'm not going to say it's autobiographical or anything, but it's just one of those wild-night kind of songs. “Situation," that's just a man who's been kicked around expressing how he feels about writers, about chicks, about labels, and anybody that's caused a little bit of adversity in his life—this is the situation, I'm just a nigga trying to make some records, what's the big deal? We got a problem, we got a situation. “You Know I Love You," love lost. Just regular shit. People can relate to it. Not necessarily autobiographical, but the feeling and sentiment is coming from somewhere. Stuff I hear in the streets, stuff that happens to me, I just try to articulate it. Sometimes it's just a feeling—a stoned black man that's young, black, gifted and educated but he's got a guitar in his hand—that's a story in itself. Just like any rapper bragging, sometimes I just stand tall and represent my people in the rock 'n' roll world, and that's important to me as well, because I feel like we were on the ground floor. A certain amount of respect between white folks and black folks, and you get rock 'n' roll. Now in the 21st century, what have we done? Where is the black man in rock 'n' roll, and where's the camaraderie and mutual respect amongst black and white artists? We don't know enough about one another to fuckin' respect each other anymore, but we had that music back in the day. You had the Grand Ole Opry and you had stations that were playing everything for the record-buying public, and it wasn't really about race.

	<br>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Do you try to deliberately address that rift through who you tour with and collaborate with?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Lamont Thomas: </strong>I try to be a good ambassador. Those are my friends, and I try to be an ambassador for my city, for the scene. My tribe is the American punk underground, and Bobby [Hussy] and those guys are a big part of it, so hell yeah, I look forward to seeing them. I look forward to seeing Spray Paint in Texas. I look forward to seeing All Blood and the Kool 100s in Kansas City. It's a tribe, those kids look up to me, and I don't want to let them down with a walk record or a bad attitude. Those kids respect me for being who I am, and that's a black man in this scene, and there's a lot of white cats in it, and I have no problem with them as long as they come real, and as long as they can play, and as long as they respect my people, or respect me at least, and thus my people.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: How'd you end up doing the cover of Neil Young's “Ohio"?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Lamont Thomas:</strong> I always wanted to do that, because I love the Isley Brothers version of that. That was a punk take on how the Isley Brothers kicked it. In a lot of cases I like to listen to the Isley Brothers version more so than Young or CSNY. Everything regarding the lyrics on <em>Boogalou Reed</em>, that record was done and then history happened as far as people getting gunned down. All the things that happened to me, it was kind of like foreshadowing. The <em>Boogalou Reed</em> record seemed more relevant as the release day approached. It was just a record and all this shit happened, and people were like, “Oh, he's singing about this and that," and I'm like, “No, I was just doing a record, and all this shit happened. You can infer what you like, but I was just recording." I was thinking about the Isley Brothers more so than anyone being gunned down or police violence or problems with the military. And I'm from Ohio. But then a bunch of people turned up dead, and so now it's got some sort of political meeting, and that's fine, because I'm pissed off about all that stuff too. If that suits your soul and you can relate to it, right on.

	<br>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Are there other songs on the record that people have read things into after the fact?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Lamont Thomas: </strong>Well, “Empire" to a certain extent. “I'm gonna tear your empire down with a pile of weed and a rebel sound." It's just sizing up the business and what's been said about me. There's been a lot of praise and a lot of underlying haters not real stoked that I'm going through some kind of renaissance and they're dead in the water or over or washed up. And I love them, and I love the records they made back then and they're still my peers, but shit. For some reason I'm able to create right now and they've got what they've got going on. Fuck it, come out and see me play. Let's go back in time for an hour or two.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: You're a father and <a href="https://twitter.com/noxrock" target="_blank">on Twitter</a> you call yourself a child psychologist?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Lamont Thomas: </strong>Oh, no, that's—being a stay-at-home dad, a self-proclaimed child psychologist. You take four or five girls to the zoo with no other supervision, you've got to be a borderline shrink. [Laughs.] Actually, I graduated in communications. I haven't worked since my kid was like a year old. I just work on the music and work on taking care of her and my house. My girlfriend is a landlord so I try to help her any way I can. Life is good, the band is picking up, it feels good, but I want more. I want more money, I want more comfort for them, I want more shine for my brothers in the underground. But I've got a pretty nice life.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: How has being a father informed your music?</strong>
</p>

	<strong>Lamont Thomas: </strong>You can't suck. If you're gonna drive away from your baby, you better do a good job. Otherwise, stay your ass home and take care of her. If you're riding off for a $50 payday off a mediocre performance, you might as well stay home and nurture your kid. Me, they give me the wherewithal to get going, and I go and try to do my best and get my ass back as quick as possible. I don't want her to wake up 20 years from now and be like, “Man, my dad made all these shitty records and people are still talking about it." I want her to be like, “Damn, my dad ruled, and they're still buying the records." Required listening. There's 20,000 kids that get turned on to Black Flag's <em>Damaged</em> every year. I want that kind of shit.

	<strong>Tone Madison: What's your live setup going to be like on Saturday?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Lamont Thomas: </strong>I'm coming with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/alive216" target="_blank">aLiVE</a>, my DJ, who helps me make the beats. Songs like “Molecule" and “How To Rob" and “Slaughter Culture," he and I cook that stuff up. He's like a J Dilla type. If you give him a rock 'n' roll record, fuck, who knows what he's gonna come up with? It's a hip-hop aesthetic to make a rock record, if you will. And then I've got John Daniel playing drums with me. A young guy, he just played his first show with me last week, but he's great. He reminds me of me when I was 25 years old. We're gonna do a mixture of the rock and the funk and the beat stuff too.

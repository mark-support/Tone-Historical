	Milwaukee-based musician Dania Luck has crafted a rigorous and focused approach to electronic music over the last seven years with her solo project 
	<a href="https://stacian.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Stacian</a>. Luck's recordings and live sets rely mostly on analog synths and drum machines, and on songwriting that evokes the resourceful austerity of electronic music's beginnings. Take the song “Micro-Trauma," from a 7-inch Stacian put out in 2011: It's a spare, driving song that occasionally bubbles up into a nimble, elaborate synth hook. Luck also hosts an <a href="http://www.wmse.org/program/wave-tank/" target="_blank">electronic-centered radio show</a> on Milwaukee's WMSE and for a time hosted an electronic/DJ night in Milwaukee called Night Flight. Recently she's been collaborating with fellow Milwaukee Billy Dimmitt, who performs under the name Pagan Woman, in a new project called Luxvid, which also reflects Luck's strengths with restrained but catchy songwriting and eerie, affected vocal melodies. The pair recently put out a <a href="https://luxvid.bandcamp.com/releases" target="_blank">self-titled digital/cassette album</a>, and will play <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/809944562427022/" target="_blank">this Saturday at Good Style Shop</a>. As Luxvid nears the end of a short tour and Luck plans future Luxvid and Stacian recordings, Luck talked with us about how the collaboration started and the duo's shared fascination with science fiction.

	<strong>Tone Madison: I was reading this <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-10-18/entertainment/ct-ott-1019-stacian-20121018_1_tape-recorder-songs-spirits" target="_blank">interview you did a few years back with the <em>Chicago Tribune</em></a>, and I liked that you ended up mentioning the crazy music machines at the House on the Rock. </strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Dania Luck:</strong> Oh, yeah, I remember that. They have a lot of synthesized fill-ins, but you can tell the ones that area actually working and the ones that are fill-ins. We allow them that headroom, I suppose, because they're so old.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: How did Luxvid come together, and how do you feel it's a departure from how you approach Stacian?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Dania Luck:</strong> I used to do this monthly night called Night Flight, a free dance party where I would DJ and sometimes have guest DJs and have one or two live bands, sometimes as many as three live bands, from within the vicinity, Chicago or Madison or somewhere. I had met Billy when he asked me to do a show at Borg Ward. Eventually he was coming to the Night Flights and asked if he could DJ at one point. He DJ'd it was really fun, and he would come DJ a lot, and we would DJ together. I think we DJ'd, like, three New Year's parties together in a row. Eventually we talked about playing music together and I was open today. We started playing and it was just really fun. That was about two years ago.
</p>
<p>
	I mean, really, it's a collaboration instead of just me, so we're bouncing ideas off each other and writing collectively, coming up with different sounds and just going, “Oh, I like that," or “No, I don't like that." It's fun to work with someone else rather than just be enclosed in my own little world of synthesizers for a change.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: And with Stacian you have a pretty well-defined sound. Do you see Luxvid as a chance to flex different muscles, musically speaking?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Dania Luck: </strong>I definitely try to blend in my own style, but we both do that. We both have a particular style that we're expressing, and I think it's an unconscious thing. I probably incorporate my own Stacian style without really thinking about it. We do use samples from my Jupiter keyboard, which is a huge contributor to the Stacian project, so there are elements of that.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Did you both go into it with some idea of what you wanted it to sound like, or did you just let that emerge through the collaborative process?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Dania Luck:</strong> I mean, we kind of have similar tastes as far as what we like and the sounds that are important, but we also have similar ideas. We both like science fiction and we both enjoy kind of an '80s throwback aesthetic, and the songwriting seems to just come really naturally to us. We're super-excited to get back to Milwaukee and start writing new stuff.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: The Luxvid songs have this balance of austere, sinister-sounding material and warmer moments—the bridge on “Holy Hell," for instance. Were you deliberately creating a contrast there?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Dania Luck: </strong>It's hard to say if that's on purpose. When we write these songs, I don't find myself saying ahead of time, “I want to write a song like this now." It's just one of the things that as we're playing, we come up with ideas to write stuff, and some of the lyrics just come out. They don't really get pre-thought-out, if that makes sense. When you ask me if it's deliberate, I'm not really sure how to answer that. If you mean deliberate by as we're playing it, then I would say, yeah, I do like the contrast of playing back and forth from sounding austere and sounding very stern to sounding very warm. I think it's like a yes and no. I think it just depends on the song itself.

<p>
	<br>
	<strong>Tone Madison: And some of your releases are really overtly built around a narrative, like the sci-fi story behind your album <em data-redactor-tag="em"><a href="https://stacian.bandcamp.com/album/songs-for-cadets" target="_blank">Songs For Cadets</a></em>. Is there any element of this on the Luxvid tape?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Dania Luck: </strong>Yeah, there's occasionally some narrative. It's hard to say what some of the songs are about. Some of them are about friendship and loss. Some are just about an idealized place. “Gemini Boys," written by Billy, is kind of about forgetting your problems and just going into the city and searching for some thing that will just fill that void of wanting and needing. There's a line, “shop for joy," is the one that stands out. There's a bit of a cynicism to parts of the song. The name Luxvid, it's from a Philip K. Dick novel, <em>The Three Stigmata Of Palmer Eldritch</em>. The bad guy in the novel wears these glasses called Luxvid glasses, and they allow him to see in 180 degrees, so I thought that was really interesting. And I like the sound of the word, and it kind of has my name in it, in a weird way.

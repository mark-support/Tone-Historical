      <p>
	Of course we love Bill Bryson. We’re two mildly pudgy American male know-it-alls, are we not? But as the Iowa native heads to Madison for a&nbsp;
	<a href="http://www.union.wisc.edu/wud/event.asp?event_id=25409" target="_blank">Distinguished Lecture Series talk on Monday Night at the Union Theater</a>, we decided to take a step back and consider just why we’ve developed such an abiding fondness over the years for this droll-witted travel writer and generalist. As we revisited our favorites and caught up on some of the Bryson books we hadn’t yet read, we traded notes and tried to suss out just why Bryson’s erudite and mildly irreverent nonfiction is so addictive, and how his persona has evolved over the years. And we picked out a few quotes that illustrate Bryson's strengths and weaknesses, and/or just make us giggle.</p><figure data-type="quote"><blockquote>
	"Iowa women are almost always sensationally overweight—you see them at Merle May Hall in Des Moines on Saturdays, clammy and meaty in their shorts and halter tops, looking a little like elephants dressed in childrens' clothes, yelling at their kids, calling out names like Dwayne and Shauna. Jack Kerouac, of all people, thought that Iowa women were the prettiest in the country, but I don't think he ever went to Merle May Hall on a Saturday. I will say this, however—and it's a strange, strange thing—the teenaged daughters of these fat women are always utterly delectable, as soft and gloriously rounded and naturally fresh-smelling as a basket of fruit. I don't know what it is that happens to them, but it must be awful to marry one of those nubile cuties knowing that there is a time bomb ticking away in her that will at some unknown date make her bloat out into something huge and grotesque, presumably all of a sudden and without much notice, like a self-inflating raft from which the pin has been yanked."
	
<p align="right">
		<em>—</em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26.The_Lost_Continent" target="_blank"><em>The Lost Continent: Travels In Small Town America</em></a> (1989)
	</p><p>
		<cite></cite>
	</p></blockquote></figure><p>
	<strong>Scott Gordon: </strong>Chris, recently you were sharing this particularly unkind passage about Iowa women from <em>The Lost Continent</em>, as an example of how Bryson can occasionally be downright nasty and condescending—not the first thing people think of when they think of Bryson, but there it is. I'm not forgiving the mild creepiness of that passage, but is it possible that he needs some of that cutting stuff&nbsp;to balance out the kindly, genteel, bumbling side?</p><p>
	<strong>Chris Lay:</strong> I think that his early stuff really <em>was</em> that caustic. It's him a little younger, with some real love/hate of the Midwest to exorcise. I need to read more of that to see if it's designed to taper off as a function of the book, but the creepiness aside I think he really just hates the Midwest and has an axe to grind with it in a cosmic sense.</p><p>
	<strong>Scott Gordon: </strong>It surprises me that you’d put it that way, because I've always picked up on a fondness for the Midwest and all things American in his books, even if he's irreverent about it. While I presume he steered clear of taking a ballooning Iowan wife, I sense a lot more self-deprecation and ambivalent affection than outright contempt in <em>The Lost Continent</em>’s eminently quotable opening line: “I come from Des Moines. Somebody had to.” He does seem willing to come off as a bumbling Midwesterner just as often as he comes off as a snob. Perhaps he means to have it both ways?</p><p>
	<strong>Chris Lay:</strong> I think it has more to do with the fact that it's just his first book. Also, this was the ’80s and there wasn't a <em>This American Life</em> sort of upper-middle-class political correctness. There's definitely good feels for the Midwest, in the abstract, but in the first 50 pages he's pretty harsh on it. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25.I_m_a_Stranger_Here_Myself" target="_blank"><em>I'm A Stranger Here Myself</em></a> collection of his columns acts as something of a course correction. It's like when a comic starts out and pushes all the "rape retard fag buttsex" buttons, because they're still experimenting with tone. When Bryson wrote <em>Lost Continent</em>, he wasn't Bill Bryson, America's foremost travel writer, and the stakes for insulting fat people were a lot lower.</p><p>
	<strong>Scott Gordon:</strong> But it's just funny that we’re starting off by talking about this snobbish aspect of Bryson, because whether he's venturing into Australia or the history of geological sciences, he always seems so willing to play the slightly oafish, slightly&nbsp;helpless American. Which is part of what makes his work so endearing.</p><p>
	<strong>Chris Lay:</strong> I think&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/526391.Notes_from_a_Big_Country?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Notes From A Big Country</em></a>, another collection of columns he wrote, is something of a retread thematically, that kind of fixes those early transgressions.</p><p>
	<strong>Scott Gordon:</strong> Yeah, this brings us to a good point: He's so good at projecting that mix of authority and self-deprecation, and maybe it took him a while to get there. It's deceptive, because it makes his work so easy to just sort of slide into, so you kind of end up taking it for granted. I mean, that gentleness is kind of everything, right? It's what makes the humor stand out.</p><p>
	<strong>Chris Lay:</strong> Totally! Reading this, I feel like I stumbled onto a Bryson secret. (Stage whispers: BRYSON SECRET!)</p><p>
	<strong>Scott Gordon:</strong> I mean generally, in his humor, he can really lay into people, but there's still a giddy innocence to all of it, and that's the fun of it.</p><p>
	<strong>Chris Lay:</strong> The character he would come to build in later works is much more fun to read, because of that lack of pretension. <em>Lost Continent</em> feels like a rough draft for stuff he would later perfect.</p><figure data-type="quote"><blockquote>
	
<p>
		"It is easy to overlook this thought that life just is. As humans we are inclined to feel that life&nbsp;must have a point. We have plans and aspirations and desires. We want to take constant advantage of all the intoxicating existence we've been endowed with. But what's life to a lichen? Yet its impulse to exist, to be, is every bit as strong as ours—arguably even stronger. If I were told that I had to spend decades being a furry growth on a rock in the woods, I believe I would lose the will to go on. Lichens don't. Like virtually all living things, they will suffer any hardship, endure any insult, for a moment's additional existence. Life, in short, just wants to be. But—and here's an interesting point—for the most part it doesn't want to be much."

	</p><p>
		<cite></cite>
	</p></blockquote></figure><p>
	<strong>Scott Gordon:</strong>&nbsp;The more we discuss this whole tonal issue, the more I think his work is a real testament to the value getting out of your comfort zone. Recently I've been catching up on <em>The Mother Tongue</em> and <em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em>, and revisiting <em>In A Sunburned Country</em>. <em>Mother Tongue</em> is a funny and engaging book (even if it sometimes feels like a ceaseless stream of linguistic trivia), but language is where Bryson dwells. But in the other two books he's decidedly out of his element—rectifying his admitted ignorance of science and encountering everything from anti-aborigine racism to deadly snails in Australia, respectively—and both are the better for it.</p><p>
	<strong>Chris Lay:</strong> There's something about his travel books that feel almost as if he'd be writing them even if he wasn't physically headed there. I haven't read any of his stuff that's not about geographical destinations, but the almost gleeful depth of research he does, particularly in <em>Sunburned Country</em>, reveals a guy who's generally curious about literally everything. That he couches it in this context where he's this bumbling man-boy (too harsh?) wandering through sometimes literal traffic gives the facts that much more readability and entertainment value. There are just the right amount of turns of phrase to keep me moving from one cultural nugget to another.</p><p>
	<strong>Scott Gordon:</strong> Right! Even though I often feel like he's just giving me the generalist's view of things, I often get engrossed in spite of myself.</p><figure data-type="quote"><blockquote>
	
<p>
		"There is evidence to suggest&nbsp;that some members of Congress aren't fully sympathetic with the necessity for a commercial nation to be multilingual. As one Congressman quite seriously told Dr.&nbsp;David Edwards, head of the Joint National Committee on Languages, 'If English was good enough for Jesus Christ, it's good enough for me.'"

		<em>—<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29.The_Mother_Tongue?ac=1" target="_blank">The Mother Tongue: English And How It Got That Way</a></em> (1990)
	</p><p>
		<cite></cite>
	</p></blockquote></figure><p>
	<strong>Chris Lay:</strong>  The book of his that I think really deviates from this the most, and is the one he's best known for, would be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9791.A_Walk_in_the_Woods" target="_blank"><em>A Walk In The Woods</em></a>, which by its very nature is a story with a set beginning and pre-determined end.</p><p>
	<strong>Scott Gordon:</strong> Whereas in other travel books, like <em>Sunburned Country</em>, there is a bit of a narrative around his trip but it's not really bound by the story. The story just becomes a jumping off point for various digressions.</p><p>
	<strong>Chris Lay: </strong>He's bound by the borders of the country, but seems to bounce around a lot, place to place willy nilly. With <em>Walk In The Woods</em> there's a very literal path—the Appalachian Trail—for him to stick to, and you see that he even manages to wander off from that, breaking from the trail at least once, if I remember correctly.</p><p>
	On the other hand, in 
	<em>Sunburned Country</em>, he does a great job of presenting a wide array of angles on Australia, which is of course a fascinating place. The thing is loaded to the gills with facts and figures and snippets of history but it reads so smoothly.&nbsp;The way he structures the prose is also really wonderful. There are a lot of things where he'll say "...more on that later, but here's a small story to illustrate the point for now," which gives the feeling of a much more cohesive work when in reality it's a bunch of smaller anecdotes for the most part.</p><figure data-type="quote"><blockquote><p>
	"In the late afternoon, I stopped at a roadhouse for gas and coffee. I studied my book of maps . . . Then, having nothing better to do, I leafed through the index and amused myself, in a very low-key way, by looking for ridiculous names, of which Australia has a respectable plenitude. I am thus able to report that the following are all real places: Wee Waa, Poowons, Borrumbuttock, Suggan Buggan, Boomahnoomoonah, Waaia, Mullumbimby Ewylamartup, Jiggalong, and the supremely satisfying Tittybong."</p><p align="right">
	—<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24.In_a_Sunburned_Country" target="_blank"><em>In A Sunburned Country</em></a> (2001)</p><cite></cite></blockquote></figure><p>
	<strong>Scott Gordon:</strong> That is definitely one of his virtues. A lesser writer would turn the same information into kind of a trivia-pelting. <em>Short History</em> isn't his funniest but it does a great job of tying together all these different strains of science throughout their formative stages. Which is important, because "science" was really quite a primordial thing until pretty recently. It's fascinating to realize just how much of it was driven by people who were essentially wealthy amateurs, or even not-so-wealthy amateurs.</p><p>
	<strong>Chris Lay:</strong> You said earlier that language is where Bryson dwells. The real saving grace for him is that he's never using $5 words and the character he has created of himself is always getting into awkward spots, but you never lose faith in him as being a trustworthy narrator factually speaking. His prose really is subtly remarkable. He communicates very complex thoughts and facts with a shocking degree of economy and ease, then somehow manages to squeeze some bright charm in there to boot.</p>

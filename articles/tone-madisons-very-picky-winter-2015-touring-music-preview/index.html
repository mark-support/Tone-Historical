	When we look at the touring music hitting Madison over the next few months, we run into a certain problem, and it's a good one to have: Sometimes the openers and the lesser-known acts excite us just as much as or more than the big names and consensus favorites do. In hip-hop, we can look forward to a bona fide legend and a young new underground standard-bearer. In jazz, a bold vocalist and an adventurous trumpeter. In metal, two Metal Blade artists playing the Orpheum and another Metal Blade band playing the Wisco. And that's just hinting at a bit of the diversity on tap for Madison in early 2015. Here's the stuff we're most excited about‚Äîkeep up with us for more detailed previews and some interviews with some of these artists over the new few months.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>JANUARY 15-18: </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1497834903835425/" target="_blank">FRZN Fest, but especially Ryley Walker, at the High Noon Saloon</a>
</p>
<p>
	The headliners at this year's four-day FRZN Fest include Cloud Nothings and Walkmen singer Hamilton Leithauser. But for now, a word about someone further down the bill on Jan. 18, the night Leithauser headlines: Chicagoan guitar prodigy Ryley Walker's 2014 debut 
	<em>All Kinds Of You</em> eschews the tacky elements that make you cringe when you hear someone utter ‚Äúguitar prodigy." Instead, Walker's tastefully complex fingerstyle playing and gorgeous, string-laden, and gimmick-free tunes invoke the influence of fallen, heart-wrenching guitar heroes like Bert Jansch, John Fahey, and Jack Rose. Split halfway between transportive, percussive folk numbers like the shuffling ‚ÄúGreat River Road" or moody waltz of ‚ÄúThe West Wind" that feature Walker's soaring croons and a handful of lushly-voiced instrumental compositions that tend to jam, float, and wander a bit more, <em>All Kinds Of You</em> is a journey of the highest order, which makes Walker's appearance worth the admission price of FRZN Fest. Walker recently announced that he'll be releasing a new album, <em>Primrose Green</em>, in March.

	<strong>JANUARY 16: </strong><a href="http://www.overturecenter.org/events/jose-james" target="_blank">Jos√© James at the Capitol Theater</a>
</p>
<p>
	Jos√© James is an incredibly modern and versatile singer who fluidly embraces jazz, pop, R&amp;B and electronic elements. This show will center around his upcoming album of Billie Holiday interpretations, 
	<em>Yesterday I Had The Blues</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-s3KycDy3I" target="_blank">this concert video from 2012</a> might give you some idea of what to expect). But we're hoping James digs into some of his previous work as well. On his most recent solo albums, 2014's <em>While You Were Sleeping</em> and 2013's <em>No Beginning No End</em>, he sprawls across genres with an uncommon blend of suave charm and angular curiosity.

	<strong>JANUARY 23:</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/993529243997337/" target="_blank">Waka Flocka Flame at the Majestic </a>
</p>
<p>
	There's a sincere 
	<a href="http://www.tonemadison.com/articles/the-gravelly-greatness-of-waka-flocka-flame" target="_blank">place in our hearts</a> for Atlanta rapper Waka Flocka Flame, even if his set at last year's Revelry festival was decidedly on the party-time-horseshit end of the live hip-hop spectrum‚Äîthink Waka jumping about onstage and only occasionally belting out a rhyme while a DJ basically played his studio tracks.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>JANUARY 30:</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wudmusic" target="_blank">Saturday Looks Good To Me at Memorial Union Rathskeller</a>
</p>
<p>
	You could argue that Saturday Looks Good To Me, masterminded by Ann Arbor's Fred Thomas, has trod a lot of the same ground over and over again‚Äîjangly, nostalgic pop that embraces a ton of collaborators and some dub-inspired production touches. Thing is, SLGTM is working with a pretty damn charming template, and there's plenty variety and pop songcraft for those willing to dive in‚Äîdefinitely start with 2003's 
	<em>All Your Summer Songs</em>, an album that has held up beautifully in its weave of effusive hooks and airy sadness. The most recent SLGTM album, 2013's <em>One Kiss Ends It All</em>, doesn't offer that many surprises for the familiar, but still makes a virtue of Thomas' seemingly endless pop fetishism.

	<strong>FEBRUARY 3:</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/569983799769498/" target="_blank">Aesop Rock, Rob Sonic Homeboy Sandman and DJ Abilities at the Barrymore</a>
</p>
<p>
	Not to short Aesop Rock, but we can't help but get preoccupied with who he's bringing along on his current tour. New York MC Homeboy Sandman has cranked out a rich and idiosyncratic body of work in the eight years since he decided to pursue a hip-hop career. That includes two solid releases from 2014, the 
	<em>White Sands</em> EP and the full-length <em>Hallways</em>. He'll also have a tour-only cassette for sale at this show, or so he said when we interviewed him recently‚Äîlook for that piece sometime in the next few weeks. In ye olde days of Def Jux, MC and producer Rob Sonic released two underappreciated solo albums of slamming, austere songs‚Äî2004's <em>Telicatessen</em> and 2007's <em>Sabotage Gigante</em>‚Äîand he recently returned as a solo artist 2014's <em>Alice In Thunderdome</em>, so we hope we get to hear some of his solo work here as well as his collaborations with Aesop under the name Hail Mary Mallon. DJ Abilities was recently added to this show, so there's nothing to sniff at in this lineup.

	<strong>FEBRUARY 7:</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/952080248154836/" target="_blank">Downfall Of Gaia, Zebras, Bereft, and The Central at The Wisco</a>
</p>
<p>
	When German band Downfall Of Gaia last played Madison, in September 2013, they filled up the Dragonfly Lounge with desolate, dynamic, long-form slabs of post-metal. Since then, they've released new album, 2014's 
	<em>Aeon Unveils The Thrones Of Decay</em>, which deftly combines brutal black-metal and doom influences with more delicate, expansive elements, but still doesn't quite do justice to the overpowering live experience. <strong>Update:</strong> Milwaukee's Protestant, previously on the bill, had to drop off; we still recommend the band's 2014 album <em><a href="https://haloofflies.bandcamp.com/album/in-thy-name" target="_blank">In Thy Name</a>,</em> an excellent work of grimy, grandiose hardcore.

	<strong>FEBRUARY 8: </strong><a href="http://russjohnsonmusic.wordpress.com/2014/12/23/2015-winter-gig-schedule/" target="_blank">Russ Johnson Quartet at The Brink</a>
</p>
<p>
	Jazz trumpeter Russ Johnson is currently based in Milwaukee, but also maintains robust ties to Madison (including work with UW-Madison jazz fixture Johannes Wallmann) and to Chicago, where he's struck up a number of collaborations and earned 
	<a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2012/11/21/trumpeter-russ-johnson-raises-his-chicago-profile" target="_blank">repeated praise</a> from the <em>Chicago Reader</em>'s jazz critics. He'll be playing this show with the three Chicago-based musicians with whom he recorded 2014's engaging, slyly subversive album <em>Meeting Point</em>: Jason Stein on bass clarinet, Anton Hatwich on bass, and Tim Daisy on drums. In addition to the original compositions of Meeting Point, 2014 also saw Johnson release <em>Still Out To Lunch!</em>, a tribute to Eric Dolphy.

	<strong>FEBRUARY 15:</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/683884628362242/" target="_blank">Zap Mama and Antibalas at Union Theater</a>
</p>
<p>
	New York's Antibalas have a respectable and fierce grasp on Afrobeat but aren't afraid to take stylistic risks with the form, especially on 2012's self-titled album. So we're intrigued to see what results when they come here on with African folk-channeling a capella group Zap Mama, for a night that will span both separate and collaborative performances.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>FEBRUARY 18:</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/947052311990431/" target="_blank">Behemoth and Cannibal Corpse at the Orpheum</a>
</p>
<p>
	Cannibal Corpse got death metal down to a grisly science in the late 1980s and haven't changed much since‚Äîeven as bands they influence continually re-invent the subgenre, Cannibal Corpse remain one of those metal bands that takes a certain perverse pride in essentially doing the same thing over and over again. That'll make for a nice contrast with long-running Polish band Behemoth, who've always had a more stately and epic take on death metal and still sound creatively hungry, turning in one of the finest metal albums of 2014, 
	<em>The Satanist</em>.

</p>
<p>
	Here in Madison we get a lot of chances to see individual members of Minneapolis' Doomtree hip-hop crew‚Äîincluding P.O.S., Dessa, and Sims‚Äîbut this time all seven of them will hit town together behind a new all-crew album, 
	<em>All Hands</em>, out Jan. 27. Doomtree's MCs and producers all have pretty distinct artistic identities, but the full-group affairs‚Äîincluding 2008's <em>Doomtree</em> and 2011's <em>No Kings</em>‚Äîare special in their own ways, madly stuffed with all the dark heavy-handedness, brash smart-assery, and restless creativity we've come to expect from this crew over the years.

	<strong>FEBRUARY 22:</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/597514033727777/" target="_blank">Suuns and Disappears at The Frequency</a>
</p>
<p>
	We've always been fans of Disappears' sonically spatial and rhythmically pounding approach to psych-rock, but the songs these Chicagoan cosmonauts have created for the upcoming full-length 
	<em>Irreal</em> are gorgeously next-level mindfucks. Some of this can be attributed to the rhythmic synergy between drummer Noah Leger and bassist Damon Carruesco, as they hammer out the sneaky polyrhythms of ‚ÄúHalcyon Days," not to mention the acidic guitar and ominous vocals of Brian Case on  ‚ÄúAnother Thought." Also, the enlisted production of The Paper Chase's John Congleton really brings a special clarity to these warped tunes. While we're always stoked to get sonically pounded by a Disappears live set, we can't wait to hear how these new, more elaborately produced tunes translate in that setting.

	<strong>FEBRUARY 23: </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/579753088824207/" target="_blank">Robyn Hitchcock at High Noon Saloon</a>
</p>
<p>
	While nothing on 2014's 
	<em>The Man Upstairs</em>‚Äîan uneven collection of originals and covers‚Äî quite matched any of the gorgeous acid-pop explorations we fell for on 2010's brilliant <em>Propellor Time</em>, we certainly aren't any less excited for an appearance from breezily-voiced psych-lord and ex-Soft Boy Robyn Hitchcock. With such a daunting back catalog, it's tough to speculate on what he'll have up his sleeve‚Äîwhether it's the sweeping, transportive chord progression of ‚ÄúI Often Dream Of Trains," the morbidly sugary ‚ÄúMy Wife &amp; My Dead Wife," or if we luck out and he sneaks a couple Soft Boys tunes in‚Äîwe'll gladly take what we can get.

	<strong>FEBRUARY 28: </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/388733811291848/" target="_blank">Prhyme (DJ Premier and Royce Da 5'9") at High Noon Saloon</a>
</p>
<p>
	This is hands-down the show we're most excited for this winter: One of hip-hop's all-time great producers, and a very solid MC, in a medium-sized club. DJ Premier's timeless, warm-yet-no-frills production indelibly shaped the sound of '90s hip-hop in the great Gang Starr and with tracks for artists ranging from Nas to Rah Digga. Rapper Royce Da 5'9" might not be as iconic, and his greatness might be a bit more scattered about, from the supergroup Slaughterhouse to guest spots with fellow Detroiters Eminem and Black Milk. But he proves himself a worthy collaborator for Preem on the pair's recently released album, 
	<em>Prhyme</em>. Standout tracks like ‚ÄúYou Should Know" and ‚ÄúWishin'" prove that Premier still has an excellent touch and that Royce's years as an underdog have turned him into a sharply introspective standout.

	<strong>MARCH 6:</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wudmusic" target="_blank">Lust For Youth at Memorial Union Rathskeller</a>
</p>
<p>
	Swedish producer Hannes Norrvide's three releases for Sacred Bones under the name Lust For Youth have traveled from the starkly abrasive (2011's 
	<em>Growing Seeds</em>) to the polished (last year's <em>International</em>), steadily advancing the project toward an endearingly warped electro-pop vision. Sure, on an <em>International</em> track like ‚ÄúArmida" you could be forgiven for initially lumping in LFY with any number of other synth-pop revival youngsters, but there's still plenty of strange detail bristling beneath the project's newly shiny surface.

	<strong>MARCH 12:</strong> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1536597489932235/" target="_blank">Helmet at High Noon Saloon</a>
</p>
<p>
	We can't argue with the massive influence that 1994 Helmet classic 
	<em>Betty</em> has had on so many bands we've held dear over the last decade, whether they'd admit or not. The dreamy grit of the chorus of ‚ÄúI Know" can be heard in the chord progressions of so many Deftones tunes; the pummeling and precise syncopation and messy jazz influence of ‚ÄúTic" is was pumped full of steroids and set ablaze by bands like Converge and Meshuggah; and the tightrope between hardcore and witty pop-rock has been sprint across repeatedly by the likes of Cave In and Jesu. Hell, even Battles later enlisted the talents of <em>Betty</em>-era drummer John Stanier. The 20-year anniversary of <em>Betty</em> will be justly celebrated with the latest incarnation of Helmet (of which guitarist Paige Hamilton is the sole founding member) performing the album in its entirety, along with an entire second set, which will hopefully include some favorites from 1990's <em>Strap It On</em> and 1992's <em>Meantime</em>.

	<strong>MARCH 13: </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/729458167146294/" target="_blank">Swervedriver at High Noon Saloon</a>
</p>
<p>
	When Swervedriver announced their reunion in 2008, it may well have been a bit overshadowed by the My Bloody Valentine reunion that came shortly before it. This doesn't change the fact that the ballsy Oxford, England-based shoegaze greats have been keeping their trudge toward a new album alive for nearly seven years, giving only one two-song single featuring the buzzing guitar-pop of ‚ÄúDeep Wound" and the more muted and mellow cruise of ‚ÄúDub Wound," and they're now on their third post-reunion drummer. This week the band finally announced that said new album, 
	<em>I Wasn't Born To Lose You</em>, will be released on March 3, so it's a safe bet that they'll be playing a bunch of new material, as well as some of the head-spinning rippers from albums like 1991's Raise and perhaps Swervedriver's most distinguished record, 1995's mighty <em>Ejector Seat Reservation</em>.

	<strong>MARCH 14:</strong> <a href="http://www.uniontheater.wisc.edu/Season14-15/kronos-quartet.html" target="_blank">Kronos Quartet at Union Theater</a>
</p>
<p>
	Having collaborated with everyone from Phillip Glass to Paul McCartney to Matmos, contributed to several film scores, released dozens of records for Nonesuch, received a Grammy for best chamber music performance, and prepared hundreds of arrangements, San Francisco-based legends Kronos Quartet have outstripped just about any other experimental-classical ensemble we can think of in their 40-plus years of existence. The foursome's latest work‚Äî2014's 
	<em>A Thousand Thoughts</em>‚Äîis predictably a mash of traditional pieces and interpretations of tunes from the likes of Omar Souleyman, Blind Willie Johnson, and Terry Riley. Yeah, perhaps we're getting old, but we're ready to be enveloped in a wash of weeping strings.

	<strong>MARCH 19: </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1006068509420053/" target="_blank">Cursive at High Noon Saloon</a>
</p>
<p>
	Many writers have been reexamining and reaffirming the significance of Omaha band Cursive since the recent remastering and reissue of 2003's cello-laden and ultra-ambitious full-length (though vocalist Tim Kasher swears it's not a concept record) 
	<em>The Ugly Organ</em>. There's good reason why Cursive never totally faded into the background like so many of their Saddle Creek peers‚Äîthe uncomfortably raw lyrics spilling from Kasher's cracking voice, the angular cello and guitar interplay, and the detailed songwriting have helped ensure that the old stuff ages well and the new material stays progressive and interesting. We'd imagine that with the rerelease of <em>The Ugly Organ</em> so close behind, this would be a great opportunity to hear a wealth of those tunes live.

	<strong>MARCH 27:</strong> <a href="http://www.high-noon.com/event/741197-dvs1-madison/" target="_blank">DVS1 at High Noon Saloon</a>
</p>
<p>
	In a scene where it's become increasingly trendy to crutch on the nostalgic sounds of vintage drum machines and make your recordings as abrasively dusty-sounding as possible, there's refreshingly little that's retro about Minneapolis-based techno mainstay Zak Khutoretsky's (a.k.a. DVS1) meticulously pristine and futuristic approach to techno. With the exception of a few hi-hats, every sound and effect on 2014's 
	<em>KW13</em>‚ÄîDVS1's most recent entry for legendary Berghain resident Ben Klock's Klockworks label‚Äîsounds virtually sourceless. From the forceful kicks to the sparkling synth arpeggios to the layered chord stabs, every element sounds as if it were slowly and methodically molded by Khutoretsky's bare hands. No openers for this one, just DVS1 jamming for four hours. Madison rarely gets treated to sets from techno artists of this caliber, so we highly recommend you seize this rare opportunity to hear why this insane veteran has labels like Transmat and Klockworks banging on his door.

	<strong>APRIL 4: </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/371173586376734/" target="_blank">Belle &amp; Sebastian at Overture Hall</a>
</p>
<p>
	Even as fans, we have to say that in our experience Belle &amp; Sebastian can be a pretty dull live act‚ÄîStuart Murdoch and Co. are the world's leading purveyors of retiring, wry, narrative-obsessed folk-pop, after all. That doesn't shake our conviction that the Scottish outfit's first two albums, 
	<em>Tigermilk</em> and <em>If You're Feeling Sinister</em>, are classics, and if the band's first-ever Madison show includes, say, a vigorous rendition of ‚ÄúMe And The Major," that'll probably be enough to make us happy.

	<strong>APRIL 22: </strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/467946666676681" target="_blank">Six Organs Of Admittance at Frequency</a>
</p>
<p>
	We were sort of wary when we read Six Organs Of Admittance mastermind Ben Chasny's recent journal entry about the seemingly convoluted concept behind his forthcoming album 
	<em>Hexadic</em> (his first since 2012's <em>Ascent</em>), which seems to revolve around a deck of playing cards. After all, Chasny also announced that Drag City would be releasing decks of Six Organs playing cards, which felt awfully schticky. However, we then listened to ‚ÄúWax Chance," the album's first single, we immediately realized that whatever Chasny's doing differently this time around‚Äîit's fucking working. Opening with a crackling blast of guitar noise, the filthy, trash-fuzz riffing of ‚ÄúWax Chance" sways and prods, with each note landing steps away from where your ears expect. Chasny's vocals pop in and out like a ghostly whack-a-mole, as the rhythm section pounds out a waltzing doom backdrop. We're excited to see if the rest of the record offers more of that much-needed ingredient to keep modern psych-rock interesting‚Äîsurprise.

</p>
<p>
	Recently it's been good to read that the 73-year-old George Clinton is apparently pulling himself together, sobering up, completing Funkadelic's 2014 triple album 
	<em>First Ya Gotta Shake The Gate</em>, and releasing a memoir with the amazing title <em>Brothas Be, Yo Like George, Ain't That Funkin' Kinda Hard on You?</em> Recently, Parliament-Funkadelic shows are less about Clinton and more about the sprawling collective of musicians he's gathered over the years, but that means you'll likely get a good cross-section of Clinton's legacy, from relatively straight-ahead funk anthems like ‚ÄúGive Up The Funk" to selections from fractured Funkadelic psych-soul classics like <em>Maggot Brain</em>.

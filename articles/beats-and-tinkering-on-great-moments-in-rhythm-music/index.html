      <p>
	Madison musician David Libert released his new album under the name Kola Gong,&nbsp;<a href="http://vidlibert.bandcamp.com/album/kola-gong-great-moments-in-rhythm-music" target="_blank"><em>Great Moments In Rhythm Music</em></a>, before heading out of town to travel around for an indefinite period. While it’s got some things in common with the&nbsp;<a href="http://vidlibert.bandcamp.com/album/return-to-mayaguez" target="_blank">earnest folksongs</a> of the albums he’s released under the name Vid Libert, the Kola Gong material represents a couple of years banging around on bass and drums in a friend’s home studio on the east side, and building up songs from the resulting rhythm tracks. He ended up with a jumble of 25 finished tracks, some of them instrumentals that reflect his love of weird, lo-fi, dub-inspired production, and many that showcase his friendly, funny, reflective persona as a songwriter. "Ted K” ponders the Unabomber, but with such offhanded dismissiveness that it becomes funny: “Ted K was a narcissist / Couldn't you tell by his cool shades?” But he’s just as often earnest, as on the lovely “Barry Gibb,” when he sings: “I want to show the world how to mend its broken heart / My brothers would come along, and each would play a part / I want to wear white suits with a touch of baby blue / Then we’d hit the dance floor with elevated shoes.” Libert met up with me recently to talk about the album and his approach to the creative process.</p><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: How did the Kola Gong stuff develop into something separate from the Vid Libert songs?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>David Libert: </strong>The Vid Libert stuff, I wanted to keep that name a little bit pure, in the sense that it's simpler, songwriter stuff, and I always approached it by starting song with a guitar and having a melody, and Kola Gong was specifically opposite that. And I was still doing that, and haven't released those songs, but that's the kind of stuff you do quietly in your bedroom. I have a studio space not far from the river here, and I get to be loud, I get to play drums, and I get to play bass. I love playing drums and bass, and I like when songs start from that backbone, just as much as having a well-written song.</p><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: With the Vid Libert stuff there's something of a defined point of view and a songwriting voice, and with the Kola Gong stuff it seems like you give yourself more license to play around and experiment.</strong></p><p>
	<strong>David Libert: </strong>On that group of songs, there were probably only two or three that were written on a guitar in a bedroom and transferred into that, and they're pretty obvious. "Observation Deck" is one of them. But most of them are just, I lay down a bunch of drums, and I loop them in a sampler, and then I mess with the sound, and then I would play bass. I made 60, 70 sketches of songs in a month… and they were all about a minute long. I said, "Oh, I'll make a 'Double Nickels On The Dime,' except for dub-y psych stuff." And then I started working on the songs and I realized that some of the rhythms I wanted to turn into two- or three-minute songs. The whole concept change over the two years that I was recording it.</p><p>
	I think it has a cohesive feel to it. I made a point of not messing with the guitar tone. The rhythms and the feel—one song might have more Afrobeat, one might have an almost garage-rock thing—the styles might be different, but I wanted it to sound like it was recorded in the same session. It's important. There's got to be some cohesiveness or else it's one of those albums that you've hear before where everything's good but it doesn't work together. I wanted it to somehow work together. There were  a lot of times where I was like, "Oh, I should bring a Rhodes in here," and I have a Rhodes, but there's no Rhodes on there. It would have just been, "Oh, that's his jazz song." Or, "Oh, I should bring in a horn section." It would have made some of those songs a lot better. But it would have been, "Oh, here's the part where he was the clever guy who wrote a horn part." It would have serviced the song, but as an album… it would have just been too clever.</p><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Some of the rhythms do stick out—"Master Of Soul" has this almost disco feel that you don't hear elsewhere on the album.</strong></p><p>
	<strong>David Libert: </strong>That was one of the first sketches I made. If you listen to the sketches—I had them on my iPod because I would listen to them all the time and I would take notes on how they should be and I was writing lyrics over them—the first five or six are all disco. I must have used that loop on that sample, and I would just do different beats. ["Master Of Soul"] was the only one that made the cut because I was like, "You can only have like one real disco song." I would love to do a whole album of disco, but it would confuse the listener.</p><p>
	I believe deeply in everyone having a creative outlet. I tell people all the time: You could coach a basketball team, and your creativity could be how to come up with an offense for these kids. It could be something that absurd. And no one thinks about it as art, but it's creative. You have to force yourself to be on your wits. for me, music is it… It's kind of a loner activity, and then when I get together with friends it's fun. I'm just a so-so bandleader. It's hard for me to herd the cats, but if I ever did, it would be good…</p><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: When you say it's a loner activity, does a lot of that come from a headspace of solitude or reflection for you?</strong></p><p>
	<strong>David Libert: </strong>Yeah. I might be starting to get over this, but I don't know how to record anything. I'm not an engineer. I don't have the tools because I don't have money. I'm just DIY, and it's not because of some ethic or belief system, it's because I like doing it. There's no way for me to learn how to do this unless I do this. If I farmed this guitar part out to you because you're better, well, that would make the song better, yes. But the song being good is actually of secondary importance to me being creative, because that's why I did this in the first place. Every one of my songs, I have a whole idea of how it could be better.</p><p>
	I always promise myself that when I'm 45, I'm gonna make a best of Vid album, and I'm gonna play any of the fucking instruments. I'm not gonna be at at the board—</p><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: You'll just give other people the songs and not be involved in it.</strong></p><p>
	<strong>David Libert: </strong>You're talented, now you go ahead, and it's going to be engineered properly, and the mics will be the right distance from the guitar amp. That's my present to myself. It's gonna be good.</p><p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: One thing that sticks out here is that some of the lyrics are a lot more playful than what you've done before. "Barry Gibb," that sounds like a sincere song but also playful.</strong></p><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2759715438/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=2783535684/transparent=true/" seamless="">&amp;lt;a href="http://vidlibert.bandcamp.com/album/kola-gong-great-moments-in-rhythm-music"&amp;gt;Kola Gong: Great Moments In Rhythm Music by Vid Libert&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;</iframe><p>
	<strong>David Libert: </strong>There's some absurdity. It's important. Writing songs is weird because people who know me think of me as the goofball on the job or the goofball at the bar or the goofball walking down the street, but lyrics have always been a way for me to talk about things that are in my head philosophically. But at the same time it was good to just be ridiculous, because I'm a pretty ridiculous person. Art should reflect that element of yourself too.</p>

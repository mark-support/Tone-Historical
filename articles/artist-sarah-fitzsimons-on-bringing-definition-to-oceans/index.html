	<a href="http://www.wisconsinacademy.org/gallery/current-exhibition" target="_blank"><em>Waterways</em>, running through May 10 at the Wisconsin Academy's James Watrous Gallery in the Overture Center</a>, brings together three Wisconsin artists to consider how the ubiquitous forces of water shape us, both in our all-important interactions with Wisconsin's lakes and rivers and on a global scale. Milwaukee artist <a href="http://www.marshamcdonaldart.com/site2/h_o_m_e.html" target="_blank">Marsha McDonald</a>'s glittering installation "1,000 Canoes," curving around the Overture Center's third-store atrium, is both a show-stealer and a through line, trying together McDonald's works with those of Madison-based artists <a href="http://www.sarahfitzsimons.net/" target="_blank">Sarah FitzSimons</a> and <a href="http://www.grayjaygraphics.com/" target="_blank">John Miller</a>. FitzSimons' section of the show combines porcelain sculptures of waves, her ongoing effort to stitch a large quilt representing the Pacific Ocean, and a wall of notes, sketches, and background materials from her studio. Miller, in a series of brightly colored screen prints, contemplates the varied and fascinating ways that light plays off the surface of a body of water. On another wall, visitors to the show can write Post-It notes sharing their own experiences and thoughts on water. FitzSimons, who also works as an art professor at UW-Madison, talked with me recently about the show as a whole and how she tackles water through an evolving mix of quilting, sculpture, installation art, and scientific inquiry.<br>

<p>
	<strong>Tone Madison: Have you had a chance to go to the gallery since the show as been up and experience how all the art sits together?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Sarah FitzSimons:</strong> I was there for the installation, but after that I haven't really been back. I think it works well together overall. My work that I have in the show, it's all sketches and models proposals and preparatory drawings, and so I don't necessarily have finished pieces in the exhibition in the way that Marsha and John do. In John's case it's nice because they included his finished prints plus the drawings. His sketches are just so beautiful. In my case, since the projects are so large and ongoing, there just wasn't room and the timing wasn't right to do a huge actual piece. In that case I think it worked really well. Group shows can definitely be challenging if you work with space, but from what I saw I felt it flowed really well, and I was there while people were setting up.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: And for something like the "Pacific Quilt," it's got a large scope and maybe it makes sense to see it in various stages of completion.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Sarah FitzSimons:</strong> Yeah, and to be honest it's going to take another year to finish it. So, to be practical, and also I think with a lot of my work the sketches and preparatory models become part of the piece and I don't look at them as something lesser, necessarily.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: With the "Pacific Quilt" piece, you're dealing with the shape of an ocean, and it makes you realize that we usually need the continents as a reference point to visualize an ocean. Here you're taking it out of that context—is that a disorienting process, and is there an interest there in sort of breaking out an ocean as a geographic entity?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Sarah FitzSimons:</strong> Certainly. And you could say the same thing about the continents—that they exist in relation to the oceans. We're just more used to seeing those taken out, for example the shape of North America, a territory we're familiar with partly because of the political divisions. Whereas the territory of the whole Pacific Ocean is a shape we're not used to seeing on its own, because one, it's not under one country's control, it's a shared territory, and two, it is a more fluid entity. With a few works in the show, I was thinking about ways to turn bodies of water into objects and turn that around in my head and better understand them, so it made sense to solidify it into this object. I'm not really solidifying the ocean into a block of stone, like Maya Lin, who's done some beautiful pieces where she takes the symmetry of a lake and will solidify it and show it in three dimensions. I'm using a solid material, which is fabric, but there's a lot of flow to fabric. We talk about water flowing and fabric flowing. Water covers things, and fabric also covers things and can move.
</p>
<p>
	I've been thinking about these constantly shifting ocean boundaries. Maybe in the future, I might do some works where it's a projected ocean perimeter, meaning, what does it look like when sea level rises 50 feet. It'd be a very different shape. Indeed, the continents would be a different shape.
</p>

<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: Right, and as you're making this representation of the Pacific, all kinds of other things are changing, from sea levels to currents to nutrient cycles. How does that influence this long-term project of the quilt?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Sarah FitzSimons: </strong>I've always been fascinated with these processes. I studied it a bit in school as an undergrad and a grad student, and actually while I've been working on it I've have a number of different podcasts and courses in advanced hydrology and oceanography I've been trying to listen to. It's a hugely complex system, and one of the reasons why [the quilt is] so detailed and taking so long is I felt in order to portray something so complex, it would be better to have it be incredibly richly surfaced and detailed. I could have done this piece pretty fast if I'd done printing on fabric, but there's something about the really detailed work in the quilting process. You can just look at it and see how much time it took. Not every piece I do is like that, but this one had to be like that to bring into mind the complexity and richness of it as a system. And then in terms of things like sea-level rise and all these processes, these are things that are very interesting but pretty remote from our day-to-day lives, unless you happen to live on the ocean or you're a research.
</p>
<p>
	One of the other reasons I wanted to make this a quilt is to bring it into the domestic setting and have it be something you have to interact with every day. You're sleeping under it. And so in that way there's this connection established—“Here I am interacting with this ocean quilt that's taking over my bedroom and half the house." It establishes a little bit of a bridge, at least in my mind, between this huge natural system and our day-to-day, smaller systems. I think part of the way people talk about people changing things and the environment improving, it's not necessarily more education. We have a lot of education and it's helpful, but if people really learn to care on a personal level about what happens to these places, these systems, these entities, these watersheds, these oceans—I see it as a way to establish a more personal connection there. I'm not so interested in just making more didactic panels for science museums, even though those are important. I'm going for something a little bit more ambiguous, in the way that a poem is more ambiguous than a non-fiction article in a magazine talking about pollution.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: Your part of the show also includes these small porcelain sculptures of waves, and the description with that mentions that you'd like to make larger versions of them. How do you envision those being used?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Sarah FitzSimons: </strong>That's a project that's been on hold a little bit. I made these models and I've been tossing it around in my head, and it's on the back burner. I like the idea of these solidified forms, and I think it could be interesting to see them life-size, these giant ceramic forms. I guess I'm not 100 percent behind that yet. I have the materials in my studio and I could get started any time, but I've got this ocean quilt and these architectural structures and another newer piece, and those are more pressing right now. I'm still also tossing around in my head if I like [the waves] better as smaller figurines. I'm not sure about that.

<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: Is water a relatively new theme for you as an artist?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Sarah FitzSimons:</strong> No, I've dealt with that for a long time, although it's not the main focus. When I lived in Los Angeles, I did a couple of pieces directly in the ocean, with the ocean as material and other materials involved, so I've lived both with water as a physical material and then also now these representations of water in other material. I'm very interested in river systems. I still haven't figured out what to do with the lakes in Madison. All of these big dynamic natural forces, for example water systems, or a glacier, I've done work with glaciers, mountains, deserts, all those big chunks of terrain have been an interest.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: You mentioned earlier that you're trying to learn a lot about hydrology and oceanography as you work. Is making art an interesting way to process those concepts as you try to master them?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Sarah FitzSimons: </strong>Yeah, that's why I love that stuff. I was always more interested to go to a geomorphology class—in fact, I took a number of geomorphology classes in school as a graduate student, and I would just sit in these classes and soak it all up and think, “Wow, I could do a project with that." I've always been interested in the hard science behind it, but I've alway seen it as inherently metaphoric for other things, connections to human emotions and our domestic routines. In other life, maybe I would have been an oceanographer or geomorphologist. I'm still fascinated by that stuff, but in reality, when I looked into it, you end up working for oil companies most of the time, so even if I was going to go into one of those fields, I wouldn't have the freedom I have in art. In art, you can bring anything in. I can learn all the science and read the texts and be fascinated by it, and research it, but then I can bring in these other poetic levels that I never could do if I was in it for the science perspective. The ironic thing is, I have better access to grant money as an artist doing work about science than I would ever have as a scientist who wants to bring some art into the science. Even though it's challenging to get grants in any field, art's a pretty open terrain in that respect.
</p>
<p>
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Tone Madison: And not only are there works in progress, but your part of the show includes this whole wall of notes and fragments and sketches. What's the value of taking things like that and putting it out there in a gallery setting?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>

	Sarah FitzSimons: </strong>I think for many people coming to see these shows, they're maybe not artists themselves, and it's a real mystery as to how work gets created. You just go to the gallery or the museum and you see the finished piece, and there's no backstory to that—unless you visit the artist's studio, which is one of my favorite things, to look around people's studios, what note they have up on the wall, because it lets you into their thinking process and you can understand how things develop. I find that whenever I have people into my studio, they're drawn to looking at those things as well. I don't see enough shows that reveal that side of the artistic process, so I was really happy when the Watrous Gallery wanted to dedicate some space to that. I think it's important for people to understand that finished work is the result of a long process, and the objects and sketches that come up along the way can be just as important and beautiful sometimes.
